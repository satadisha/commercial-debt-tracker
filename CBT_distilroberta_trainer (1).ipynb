Share Repurchase Program  The Company announced today the acceleration of its capital return plan with a $150 million share repurchase plan effective through the end of 2016 that was approved by the Companys Board of Directors.  The Company currently intends to repurchase its shares over time through a combination of the tender offer referred to below and open market purchases, and may also repurchase shares through private transactions, exchange offers, additional tender offers or other means. The Company intends to fund this program using its working capital.  Modified Dutch Auction Tender Offer  Under the new share repurchase program, the Company announced that it plans to launch promptly a modified Dutch auction tender offer to purchase up to $75 million of its common stock, at a price per share of not less than $8.50 and not greater than $9.25.  The tender offer will be contingent upon satisfaction of customary conditions. Additional details regarding the pricing and other terms will be provided upon formal commencement of the tender offer.  The Company had approximately 117.4 million shares of common stock outstanding as of October 28, 2015.  2  Information Regarding the Planned Tender Offer  This description is for informational purposes only and is not an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell any shares of the Companys common stock. The planned tender offer described in this Item 8.01 has not yet commenced, and there can be no assurance that the Company will commence the tender offer on the terms described in this Item 8.01 or at all. If the Company commences the tender offer, the tender offer will be made solely by an Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal, as they may be amended or supplemented.  Stockholders and investors are urged to read any Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO filed by the Company with the SEC in connection with the tender offer including the Offer to Purchase, the related Letter of Transmittal and other offer materials and exhibits thereto, as well as any amendments or supplements to the Schedule TO when they become available, because they will contain important information. If the Company commences the tender offer, it will file each of the documents referenced in this paragraph with the SEC, and, when available, investors may obtain them for free from the SEC at its website (www.sec.gov) or from the Companys information agent engaged in connection with the tender offer.  Note Regarding Share Repurchase Program  The Companys announcement of its share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of its shares of common stock. The Company will determine when, if and how to proceed with any repurchase transactions under the program, as well as the amount of any such repurchase transactions, based upon, among other things, the results of the tender offer and the Companys evaluation of its liquidity and capital needs (including for strategic and other opportunities), its business, results of operations, and financial position and prospects, general financial, economic and market conditions, prevailing market prices for the Companys shares of common stock, corporate, regulatory and legal requirements, and other conditions and factors deemed relevant by the Companys management and Board of Directors from time to time. The share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. There can be no assurance as to the actual volume of share repurchases in any given period or over the term of the program, if any, or as to the manner or terms of any such repurchases. The information in this Item 8.01 does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities in any jurisdiction.\",\n          \" On August 16, 2021, Enstar Group Limited (the \\\"Company\\\") issued a press release announcing the commencement of a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of its outstanding 4.500% Senior Notes due 2022 (the \\\"Tender Offer\\\").

Morgan Securities LLC and Credit Suisse Securities (USA), LLC, as representatives (the  Representatives ) of the several underwriters named therein (the  Underwriters ), in connection with an underwritten public offering of up to 8,855,000 shares of common stock (the  Common Shares ), including the Underwriters option to purchase up to an  additional 1,155,000 Common Shares. On October 1, 2015, the Underwriters exercised in full their option to purchase additional Common Shares. The Company expects the net proceeds from the offering to be approximately $794 million, after deducting  estimated fees and expenses. Net proceeds from the offering are expected to be used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the Companys credit facility, which were used in part to finance recent acquisitions, and for general corporate  purposes, including funding potential future acquisitions. The issuance and sale of the Common Shares has been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), pursuant to an automatic shelf  Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-206172) of the Company, filed with and deemed automatically effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 6, 2015. Closing of the issuance and sale of the Common  Shares is scheduled for October 6, 2015, subject to customary closing conditions. A legal opinion relating to the validity of the Common Shares is filed herewith as Exhibit 5.1.  The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by the Company and customary conditions to closing,  obligations of the parties and termination provisions. Additionally, the Company has agreed to indemnify the Underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the Underwriters may  be required to make because of any of those liabilities. Furthermore, the Company has agreed with the Underwriters not to offer or sell any shares of its common stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock), subject to  limited exceptions, for a period of 60 days after the date of the Underwriting Agreement without the prior written consent of the Representatives.  Certain of the Underwriters and their affiliates act as administrative agent, lender, swingline lender and/or letter of credit lender under  the Companys credit facility. Further, certain of the Underwriters or their affiliates have from time to time provided investment banking, commercial banking and financial advisory services to the Company, for which they have received  customary compensation. The Underwriters and their affiliates may provide similar services in the future. In addition, from time to time, certain of the Underwriters and their affiliates may effect transactions for their own account or the account  of customers, and hold on behalf of themselves or their customers, long or short positions in the Companys debt or equity securities or loans, and may do so in the future.  The foregoing description of the Underwriting Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such Underwriting Agreement, a copy of  which is filed herewith as Exhibit 1.1 and is incorporated herein by reference....\"\n",
