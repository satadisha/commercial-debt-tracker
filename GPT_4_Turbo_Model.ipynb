(the  Company ), through its wholly owned subsidiary, COG Operating LLC  ( Seller ), entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with Plains Pipeline, L.P. ( Purchaser ) to sell 100% of the issued and  outstanding Class A Units of Alpha Holding Company, LLC ( AHC ) (the  Disposition ), for aggregate consideration of approximately $800 million, subject to customary purchase price  adjustments, after closing of the transactions contemplated by the Class B Purchase Agreement (defined below) and repayment of the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility of Alpha Crude Connector, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AHC.  Contemporaneously with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, Purchaser entered into a definitive purchase agreement with Frontier Midstream Solutions, LLC ( Frontier ) to purchase 100% of the issued and outstanding  Class B Units of AHC (the  Class  B Purchase Agreement ). Closing under the Purchase Agreement and the Class B Purchase Agreement is anticipated to occur contemporaneously during the  first half of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions, as further described below. Seller retains the right under the Limited Liability Company Agreement of AHC, subject to certain conditions, to purchase or cause AHC to purchase all of the  Class B Units of AHC prior to closing under the Purchase Agreement and the Class B Purchase Agreement (an  Option Exercise ). In the event of an Option Exercise, Seller will sell all of the Class A Units and  the Class B Units of AHC to Purchaser for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.215 billion. The Company expects the net proceeds to Seller in the event of an Option Exercise and sale to Purchaser of all of the Class A Units and  the Class B Units of AHC to be substantially similar to what Seller would otherwise receive under the Purchase Agreement in the absence of an Option Exercise.  Each partys obligation to consummate the Disposition is conditioned upon, among other things, (i) confirmation of the  counterparties representations and warranties as of the closing, (ii) the counterparties performance, in all material respects, of all covenants, (iii) the receipt of all required approvals (including approval under the  Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976), (iv) the absence of legal matters prohibiting the Disposition, and (v) the satisfaction or waiver by Frontier or Purchaser, as applicable, of certain conditions precedent to the  consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Class B Purchase Agreement.  \" → False\n",
        "2. \"    As previously disclosed, between December 14, 2022 and December 16, 2022, IronNet, Inc. (the \" Company \") issued and sold secured promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of $6.9 million (the \" Initial Notes \") to a total of eight lenders, and on December 30, 2022, the Company issued a secured promissory note in the principal amount of $2.0 million (the \" First   C5 Note \") to an entity affiliated with C5 Capital Limited (\" C5 \"), a beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Company's outstanding common stock.    In connection with the issuance of the First C5 Note, the Company and the holders of the Initial Notes agreed to amend and restate the Initial Notes to be substantially in the form to be issued to C5, which form was attached as an exhibit to the Current Report on Form  8-K  filed on January 4, 2023 (the \" Restated Initial Notes \"). This amendment and restatement occurred on January 11, 2023. The Restated Initial Notes continue to bear interest at a rate of 13.8% per annum from the respective dates of the Initial Notes, and the Restated Initial Notes are payable at scheduled maturity on June 30, 2023.    Upon entering into the First C5 Note, the Company and C5 also agreed to amend and restate the First C5 Note. Subsequently, the parties agreed that the amended and restated First C5 Note and any future notes to be issued in connection with additional bridge financing by C5 would be convertible into shares of the Company's common stock. On January 11, 2023, the Company issued to C5 an amended and restated convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $2.0 million (the \" Restated C5 Note \"). On January 12, 2023, the Company issued to C5 a new secured convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $3.0 million (the \" Second C5 Note \"). The Restated C5 Note and the Second C5 Note (collectively, the \" C5 Notes \"), in the aggregate principal amount of $5.0 million, are in substantially the form of secured convertible promissory note attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1.    The C5 Notes bear interest at a rate of 13.8% per annum from the date of issuance (or in the case of the Restated C5 Note, from the date of the First C5 Note), and all such notes are payable at scheduled maturity on June 30, 2023, subject to acceleration in certain circumstances.    The Company's obligations under the Restated Initial Notes and the C5 Notes are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company, excluding the Company's intellectual property. C5 and each of the holders of the Restated Initial Notes have executed an Amended and Restated Security Agreement in the form attached as an exhibit to the Current Report on Form  8-K  filed on January 4, 2023.    The C5 Notes provide C5 with the right, at any time on or after the date that is five calendar days prior to maturity, to convert any portion of the principal amount of the C5 Notes, together with any accrued and unpaid interest and any other unpaid amounts, into shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the \" Common Stock \"), at a conversion price of $2.00 per share. In the event that any shares of Common Stock are issued upon conversion of the C5 Notes, the Company has agreed to grant specified registration rights to C5.    The foregoing description of the C5 Notes does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the form of C5 Note filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.  \" → True\n",

Alexander (Ret.), the founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company. The Notes were also issued to lenders that include VADM John M. McConnell (Ret.), Hon. Michael J. Rogers, Theodore E. Schlein and VADM Jan E. Tighe (Ret.), each of whom is a director of the Company, as well as funds affiliated with Forgepoint Capital (the \" Forgepoint Funds \"). Donald R. Dixon, a member of the Company's board of directors, is an affiliate of ForgePoint Capital, and the ForgePoint Funds are also beneficial owners of greater than 5% of the Company's common stock.    Each Note has a scheduled maturity date of one year from the date of issuance, except that the Note issued to one lender that is not, and is not affiliated with, a director of the Company has a scheduled maturity date of six months from the date of issuance. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 13.8% per annum, payable at maturity. The Company may prepay the Notes at any time without premium or penalty, and the Notes do not restrict the incurrence of future indebtedness by the Company.    In the event that the Company fails to timely pay amounts due under the Notes or the Company materially defaults in its performance of any other covenant under the Notes or the Security Agreement (as defined below), which default is not cured within 30 days after written notice thereof, then at the option of the lenders, upon the written consent of lenders representing a majority of the outstanding and unpaid principal under the Notes, all unpaid principal, accrued interest and other amounts owing under the Notes shall be immediately due and payable.    In the event that the Company files any petition or action for relief under any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency or moratorium law or any other law for the relief of or relating to debtors, or makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors or takes any corporate action in furtherance thereof, or if an involuntary petition is filed against the Company (unless such petition is dismissed or discharged within 60 days) under any bankruptcy statute, or a custodian, receiver, trustee, assignee for the benefit of creditors is appointed to take possession, custody or control of any property of the Company, then all unpaid principal, accrued interest and other amounts owing under the Notes will accelerate and automatically become immediately due and payable.

Contemporaneously with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, Purchaser entered into a definitive purchase agreement with Frontier Midstream Solutions, LLC ( Frontier ) to purchase 100% of the issued and outstanding  Class B Units of AHC (the  Class  B Purchase Agreement ). Closing under the Purchase Agreement and the Class B Purchase Agreement is anticipated to occur contemporaneously during the  first half of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions, as further described below. Seller retains the right under the Limited Liability Company Agreement of AHC, subject to certain conditions, to purchase or cause AHC to purchase all of the  Class B Units of AHC prior to closing under the Purchase Agreement and the Class B Purchase Agreement (an  Option Exercise ). In the event of an Option Exercise, Seller will sell all of the Class A Units and  the Class B Units of AHC to Purchaser for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.215 billion. The Company expects the net proceeds to Seller in the event of an Option Exercise and sale to Purchaser of all of the Class A Units and  the Class B Units of AHC to be substantially similar to what Seller would otherwise receive under the Purchase Agreement in the absence of an Option Exercise.  Each partys obligation to consummate the Disposition is conditioned upon, among other things, (i) confirmation of the  counterparties representations and warranties as of the closing, (ii) the counterparties performance, in all material respects, of all covenants, (iii) the receipt of all required approvals (including approval under the  Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976), (iv) the absence of legal matters prohibiting the Disposition, and (v) the satisfaction or waiver by Frontier or Purchaser, as applicable, of certain conditions precedent to the  consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Class B Purchase Agreement.  \" → False\n",

In connection with the issuance of the First C5 Note, the Company and the holders of the Initial Notes agreed to amend and restate the Initial Notes to be substantially in the form to be issued to C5, which form was attached as an exhibit to the Current Report on Form  8-K  filed on January 4, 2023 (the \" Restated Initial Notes \"). This amendment and restatement occurred on January 11, 2023. The Restated Initial Notes continue to bear interest at a rate of 13.8% per annum from the respective dates of the Initial Notes, and the Restated Initial Notes are payable at scheduled maturity on June 30, 2023.    Upon entering into the First C5 Note, the Company and C5 also agreed to amend and restate the First C5 Note. Subsequently, the parties agreed that the amended and restated First C5 Note and any future notes to be issued in connection with additional bridge financing by C5 would be convertible into shares of the Company's common stock. On January 11, 2023, the Company issued to C5 an amended and restated convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $2.0 million (the \" Restated C5 Note \"). On January 12, 2023, the Company issued to C5 a new secured convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $3.0 million (the \" Second C5 Note \"). The Restated C5 Note and the Second C5 Note (collectively, the \" C5 Notes \"), in the aggregate principal amount of $5.0 million, are in substantially the form of secured convertible promissory note attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1.    The C5 Notes bear interest at a rate of 13.8% per annum from the date of issuance (or in the case of the Restated C5 Note, from the date of the First C5 Note), and all such notes are payable at scheduled maturity on June 30, 2023, subject to acceleration in certain circumstances.    The Company's obligations under the Restated Initial Notes and the C5 Notes are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company, excluding the Company's intellectual property. C5 and each of the holders of the Restated Initial Notes have executed an Amended and Restated Security Agreement in the form attached as an exhibit to the Current Report on Form  8-K  filed on January 4, 2023.    The C5 Notes provide C5 with the right, at any time on or after the date that is five calendar days prior to maturity, to convert any portion of the principal amount of the C5 Notes, together with any accrued and unpaid interest and any other unpaid amounts, into shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the \" Common Stock \"), at a conversion price of $2.00 per share.

Donald R.

Each Note has a scheduled maturity date of one year from the date of issuance, except that the Note issued to one lender that is not, and is not affiliated with, a director of the Company has a scheduled maturity date of six months from the date of issuance. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 13.8% per annum, payable at maturity. The Company may prepay the Notes at any time without premium or penalty, and the Notes do not restrict the incurrence of future indebtedness by the Company.    In the event that the Company fails to timely pay amounts due under the Notes or the Company materially defaults in its performance of any other covenant under the Notes or the Security Agreement (as defined below), which default is not cured within 30 days after written notice thereof, then at the option of the lenders, upon the written consent of lenders representing a majority of the outstanding and unpaid principal under the Notes, all unpaid principal, accrued interest and other amounts owing under the Notes shall be immediately due and payable.

C5 and each of the holders of the Restated Initial Notes have executed an Amended and Restated Security Agreement in the form attached as an exhibit to the Current Report on Form  8-K  filed on January 4, 2023.    The C5 Notes provide C5 with the right, at any time on or after the date that is five calendar days prior to maturity, to convert any portion of the principal amount of the C5 Notes, together with any accrued and unpaid interest and any other unpaid amounts, into shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the \" Common Stock \"), at a conversion price of $2.00 per share. In the event that any shares of Common Stock are issued upon conversion of the C5 Notes, the Company has agreed to grant specified registration rights to C5.    The foregoing description of the C5 Notes does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the form of C5 Note filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.  \" → True\n",
        "3. \"    Between December 14, 2022 and December 16, 2022, IronNet, Inc. (the \" Company \") issued and sold secured promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of $6.9 million (the \" Notes \") to a total of eight lenders. The lenders included GEN Keith B. Alexander (Ret.), the founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company. The Notes were also issued to lenders that include VADM John M. McConnell (Ret.), Hon. Michael J. Rogers, Theodore E. Schlein and VADM Jan E. Tighe (Ret.), each of whom is a director of the Company, as well as funds affiliated with Forgepoint Capital (the \" Forgepoint Funds \"). Donald R. Dixon, a member of the Company's board of directors, is an affiliate of ForgePoint Capital, and the ForgePoint Funds are also beneficial owners of greater than 5% of the Company's common stock.    Each Note has a scheduled maturity date of one year from the date of issuance, except that the Note issued to one lender that is not, and is not affiliated with, a director of the Company has a scheduled maturity date of six months from the date of issuance. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 13.8% per annum, payable at maturity. The Company may prepay the Notes at any time without premium or penalty, and the Notes do not restrict the incurrence of future indebtedness by the Company.    In the event that the Company fails to timely pay amounts due under the Notes or the Company materially defaults in its performance of any other covenant under the Notes or the Security Agreement (as defined below), which default is not cured within 30 days after written notice thereof, then at the option of the lenders, upon the written consent of lenders representing a majority of the outstanding and unpaid principal under the Notes, all unpaid principal, accrued interest and other amounts owing under the Notes shall be immediately due and payable.    In the event that the Company files any petition or action for relief under any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency or moratorium law or any other law for the relief of or relating to debtors, or makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors or takes any corporate action in furtherance thereof, or if an involuntary petition is filed against the Company (unless such petition is dismissed or discharged within 60 days) under any bankruptcy statute, or a custodian, receiver, trustee, assignee for the benefit of creditors is appointed to take possession, custody or control of any property of the Company, then all unpaid principal, accrued interest and other amounts owing under the Notes will accelerate and automatically become immediately due and payable.    The Notes are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company, excluding the Company's intellectual property. The Company entered into a Security Agreement (the \" Security Agreements \") with each of the lenders.    The forgoing descriptions of the Notes and the Security Agreements do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, the form of Note and form of Security Agreement filed hereto as Exhibits 4.1 and 10.1, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.  \" → True\n",

These events are considered material, meaning they could impact the company's financial performance or investor decisions. Debt financing is when a company borrows money (or is given the right to borrow money) from a collection of lenders. This is primarily done through bonds, notes, loans, credit facilities. Key words include: Term Loan Agreement, Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, Revolving Credit Agreement, Junior Subordinated Notes, Bond, Debt Settlement Agreement.Classification is 'True' if the item contains details about a debt instrument. If the item just references a debt instrument, this column should still be false. There must be some details outside of the name (such as the start date, the amount, the lenders, etc.). I want you to think like a financial analyst reviewing SEC Form 8-K filings to determine whether they contain information related to commercial debt. Your response should classify each text with a “True” or “False” label. Do not explain.\n",

        "1. \"As previously disclosed, between December 14, 2022 and December 16, 2022, IronNet, Inc. This Company  issued and sold secured promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of $6.9 million (the Initial Notes)  to a total of eight lenders, and on December 30, 2022, the Company issued a secured promissory note in the principal amount of $2.0 million (the First C5 Note ) to an entity affiliated with C5 Capital Limited, a beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Company's outstanding common stock. In connection with the issuance of the First C5 Note, the Company and the holders of the Initial Notes agreed to amend and restate the Initial Notes to be substantially in the form to be issued to C5, which form was attached as an exhibit to the Current Report on Form  8-K  filed on January 4, 2023 (the  Restated Initial Notes). This amendment and restatement occurred on January 11, 2023. The Restated Initial Notes continue to bear interest at a rate of 13.8% per annum from the respective dates of the Initial Notes, and the Restated Initial Notes are payable at scheduled maturity on June 30, 2023.    Upon entering into the First C5 Note, the Company and C5 also agreed to amend and restate the First C5 Note. Subsequently, the parties agreed that the amended and restated First C5 Note and any future notes to be issued in connection with additional bridge financing by C5 would be convertible into shares of the Company's common stock. On January 11, 2023, the Company issued to C5 an amended and restated convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $2.0 million (the Restated C5 Note). On January 12, 2023, the Company issued to C5 a new secured convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $3.0 million (the Second C5 Note). The Restated C5 Note and the Second C5 Note (collectively, the C5 Notes), in the aggregate principal amount of $5.0 million, are in substantially the form of secured convertible promissory note attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1.    The C5 Notes bear interest at a rate of 13.8% per annum from the date of issuance (or in the case of the Restated C5 Note, from the date of the First C5 Note), and all such notes are payable at scheduled maturity on June 30, 2023, subject to acceleration in certain circumstances.    The Company's obligations under the Restated Initial Notes and the C5 Notes are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company, excluding the Company's intellectual property. C5 and each of the holders of the Restated Initial Notes have executed an Amended and Restated Security Agreement in the form attached as an exhibit to the Current Report on Form  8-K  filed on January 4, 2023.    The C5 Notes provide C5 with the right, at any time on or after the date that is five calendar days prior to maturity, to convert any portion of the principal amount of the C5 Notes, together with any accrued and unpaid interest and any other unpaid amounts, into shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Common Stock ), at a conversion price of $2.00 per share. In the event that any shares of Common Stock are issued upon conversion of the C5 Notes, the Company has agreed to grant specified registration rights to C5.    The foregoing description of the C5 Notes does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the form of C5 Note filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. \" → True\n",

Alexander (Ret.), the founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company. The Notes were also issued to lenders that include VADM John M. McConnell (Ret.), Hon. Michael J. Rogers, Theodore E. Schlein and VADM Jan E. Tighe (Ret.), each of whom is a director of the Company, as well as funds affiliated with Forgepoint Capital (the Forgepoint Funds). Donald R. Dixon, a member of the Company's board of directors, is an affiliate of ForgePoint Capital, and the Forgepoint Funds are also beneficial owners of greater than 5% of the Company's common stock.    Each Note has a scheduled maturity date of one year from the date of issuance, except that the Note issued to one lender that is not, and is not affiliated with, a director of the Company has a scheduled maturity date of six months from the date of issuance. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 13.8% per annum, payable at maturity. The Company may prepay the Notes at any time without premium or penalty, and the Notes do not restrict the incurrence of future indebtedness by the Company.    In the event that the Company fails to timely pay amounts due under the Notes or the Company materially defaults in its performance of any other covenant under the Notes or the Security Agreement (as defined below), which default is not cured within 30 days after written notice thereof, then at the option of the lenders, upon the written consent of lenders representing a majority of the outstanding and unpaid principal under the Notes, all unpaid principal, accrued interest and other amounts owing under the Notes shall be immediately due and payable.    In the event that the Company files any petition or action for relief under any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency or moratorium law or any other law for the relief of or relating to debtors, or makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors or takes any corporate action in furtherance thereof, or if an involuntary petition is filed against the Company (unless such petition is dismissed or discharged within 60 days) under any bankruptcy statute, or a custodian, receiver, trustee, assignee for the benefit of creditors is appointed to take possession, custody or control of any property of the Company, then all unpaid principal, accrued interest and other amounts owing under the Notes will accelerate and automatically become immediately due and payable.

        "4. \"On December 11, 2020, Innoviva, Inc. (\" Innoviva \") entered into a strategic partnership with Sarissa Capital Management LP (\" Sarissa Capital \") designed to accelerate the execution of its strategy and enhance returns on its capital. The partnership comprises (i) a strategic advisory agreement, pursuant to which and subject to the terms set forth therein Sarissa Capital will assist Innoviva in the development of its acquisition strategy and (ii) an investment by Innoviva into an investment fund managed by Sarissa Capital to enhance returns on its capital, as further described herein. The partnership is part of Innoviva's continued focus on increasing shareholder value by diversifying its primary royalty management business that includes respiratory assets partnered with Glaxo Group Limited and optimizing its capital allocation, both through actively pursuing opportunistic acquisitions of promising companies and assets in the healthcare industry and enhancing the returns on its capital. Innoviva believes that Sarissa Capital's strategic position in the healthcare ecosystem, differentiated investment approach and strategic acumen are highly synergistic with our capital deployment strategy and position us well for value creation. Strategic Advisory Agreement As part of the partnership, Innoviva and Sarissa Capital entered into a Strategic Advisory Agreement (the \" Services Agreement \"), dated December 11, 2020, pursuant to which Sarissa Capital will provide a variety of strategic services to Innoviva in order to assist Innoviva in the development and execution of its acquisition strategy. Pursuant to the terms of the Services Agreement, and subject to the limitations set forth therein, Sarissa Capital will, among other things: (i) assist Innoviva in the development of an overall acquisition and investment process and strategy; (ii) advise Innoviva on market trends, market dynamics and merger and acquisition activity; (iii) identify potential transaction targets; (iv) assist in due diligence of transaction targets and the negotiation and execution of transactions; (v) advise on the growth and operational plans, performance and integration of target companies once an investment or acquisition is made; and (vi) assist in the identification of director and officer candidates for target companies. The Services Agreement provides for the development of an annual work plan to implement the strategic services, and regular collaboration between Sarissa Capital and Innoviva to discuss the work plan and refine the strategic services. Innoviva believes that the partnership will allow it to utilize the expertise and market reach of Sarissa Capital to optimize Innoviva's proprietary investment program, targeting strategic control investments in the healthcare industry, while also focusing on Innoviva's primary business of managing its valuable royalty portfolio. The Services Agreement includes customary indemnification and exculpation provisions and is terminable by Innoviva at any time. In addition, Sarissa Capital may terminate the Services Agreement at any time in the event that one or more withdrawal requests to the Partnership (as defined below) are made which, in the aggregate, cause the value of the interest of Strategic Partners (as defined below) in the Partnership to be less than 50% of the initial subscription amount, as adjusted for any cumulative profits and losses. Investment of Capital In addition to the Services Agreement, as part of Innoviva's efforts to optimize its cash position and increase yield, on December 11, 2020, Innoviva Strategic Partners LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Innoviva (\" Strategic Partners \"), entered into a subscription agreement (the \" Subscription Agreement \") and an Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement (the \" Partnership Agreement \" and, together with the Subscription Agreement and the other instruments and agreements referenced therein or contemplated thereby, the \" Investment - 2 - Documents \") pursuant to which Strategic Partners became a limited partner of ISP Fund LP (the \" Partnership \"). The general partner of the Partnership (the \" General Partner \") is an affiliate of Sarissa Capital and, pursuant to an investment management agreement, Sarissa Capital will act as the investment adviser to the Partnership. Pursuant to the Investment Documents, Strategic Partners made a $300 million initial contribution into the Partnership on a \"most favored nations\" basis. The Partnership was formed for the purposes of investing in \"long-only\" securities in the healthcare, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. The Partnership Agreement provides certain limitations on the General Partner and the Partnership. Among other things and subject to the limitations set forth in the Partnership Agreement, without the prior approval of Strategic Partners, the Partnership may not participate in any borrowing, leverage or other credit arrangement, enter into certain transactions with Sarissa Capital or its affiliates or invest greater than 20% of the Net Asset Value (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) of the Partnership in the securities of any single issuer (measured at the time of acquisition), however we expect the Partnership's investments to be concentrated in a few larger positions in order to maximize the synergies between the Partnership Agreement, the Services Agreement and our overall acquisition strategy. As compensation for the advisory services to be provided to the Partnership, the Partnership Agreement provides for Sarissa Capital to receive a customary management fee from the Partnership, payable quarterly in advance, measured based on the Net Asset Value of Strategic Partners' capital account in the Partnership. In addition, as more fully described in the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner is entitled to a customary annual performance allocation based on the Net Profits (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) of the Partnership during the annual measurement period (i.e., the excess during the relevant annual measurement period of (x) operating profits of the Partnership plus the realized and unrealized increase in the value of securities held by the Partnership over (y) operating losses of the Partnership plus the realized and unrealized loss in the value of securities held by the Partnership). The performance allocation is payable annually (or a shorter period solely with respect to capital withdrawn from the Partnership prior to year-end) and is calculated based on valuation determinations made by Sarissa Capital or a third-party administrator for the Partnership selected by Sarissa Capital. The foregoing is the sole compensation receivable by Sarissa Capital for the transactions described herein. The Partnership Agreement includes a lock-up period of thirty-six months after which Strategic Partners is entitled to make withdrawals from the Partnership as of such lock-up expiration date and each anniversary thereafter, subject to a 25% gating provision. If Strategic Partners wishes to withdraw more than 25% of its capital, such request will be carried over to the successive quarter-end dates until settled in full over a maximum of four quarter-end dates with respect to withdrawal of the full capital account balance. Payments to Strategic Partners in respect of any withdrawal are to be made within 30 days following the relevant withdrawal effective date. In addition, the Partnership Agreement provides for withdrawal rights at any time upon the occurrence of Cause (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) or in the event of a Key Man Event (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) tied to Dr. Alexander Denner ceasing to be the Chief Investment Officer of Sarissa Capital or otherwise ceasing to oversee the investment activity of the Partnership. Following a withdrawal due to Cause or a Key Man Event, the Partnership is required to distribute withdrawal proceeds as promptly as reasonably practicable following the relevant withdrawal date and without the application of the 25% gate or the lock-up. The Partnership Agreement also provides that Strategic Partners may elect, from time to time, to receive annual distributions of Net Profits (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) net of accrued and reserved expenses and fees of the Partnership. The Partnership Agreement also requires the Partnership to make distributions to Strategic Partners as necessary to allow Innoviva to maintain compliance with the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. - 3 - The Partnership Agreement includes co-investment rights pursuant to which Strategic Partners is entitled to invest ratably in investment opportunities presented to the Partnership and other funds and accounts managed by Sarissa Capital, and capacity rights pursuant to which Strategic Partners is entitled to make additional investments into the Partnership on the same preferential terms. The Partnership Agreement also includes a customary \"most favored nations\" provision, pursuant to which and subject to certain limitations and conditions, Strategic Partners is entitled to receive the benefit of any more favorable terms or conditions (and any related negative terms or obligations) provided to investors in any other fund or account managed by Sarissa Capital or its affiliates pursuing substantially the same investment strategy. In addition to the terms described above, the Investment Documents include other customary terms and conditions including representations and warranties, indemnities, exculpation, information rights and reporting obligations and allocation of third party expenses. The execution of the Services Agreement and the Investment Documents was approved by a special committee of independent directors of the Innoviva Board represented by independent legal, financial and other advisors. Mark DiPaolo, Esq. and Odysseas D. Kostas, M.D., two of our directors, are partners of Sarissa Capital. Accordingly, these directors have recused themselves to date from any decisions relating to our investment in the Partnership or the Services Agreement. The foregoing is a summary description of certain terms of the Services Agreement and the Partnership Agreement and does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Services Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, and the Partnership Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.” → False\n",
