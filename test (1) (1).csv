        On July 12, 2006, All-State Properties, L.P., a Delaware

limited liability company (the ?Company?), entered into a letter

of intent (?LOI?) with Hubei Longdan Biological Medicine

Technology Co. Ltd., a company organized under the laws of the

People?s Republic of China (?Longdan?).

        Under the LOI, the Company and Longdan will negotiate a

definitive agreement pursuant to which the Company would acquire

all of the outstanding capital stock of Longdan (the

?Acquisition?).  Preliminary to the consummation of the

Acquisition, the Company would convert from a limited liability

company to a Delaware corporation and form a Delaware corporation

into which Longdan would merge.  The LOI contemplates that

Longdan?s shareholders will receive shares of the Company equal to

approximately ninety one percent (91%) of the Company?s issued and

outstanding capital stock for their shares of Longdan and that the

Company?s existing partners/stockholders will have approximately

nine percent (9%) of the outstanding capital stock after

consummation of the Acquisition.  Following completion of the

Acquisition, all of the officers and directors of the Company

would resign and be replaced by Longdan nominees.

        Consummation of the Acquisition is subject to several

conditions, including approval of the Acquisition by the partners

of the Company and the principals of Longdan, and delivery by

Longdan of audited financial statements reflecting profits of

approximately U.S.$2.23 million for its latest fiscal year and

shareholder equity of U.S.$14.8 million as of the end of its

latest fiscal year.  In addition, the consummation of the

Acquisition will be conditioned on the consummation of either (x)

the sale of the real property owned by Tunicom, LLC, a company in

which the Company owns a member interest, and distribution of the

proportionate net proceeds to the Company?s partners after payment

of the Company?s outstanding obligations or (y) a divesture of the

Company?s interest in Tunicom to an entity holding such interest

for the benefit of the Company?s partners and the related

assumption of all of the Company?s outstanding obligations.  Under

the LOI, Longdan is obligated to pay all of the Company?s costs

incurred in connection with the Acquisition and related

transactions.

The LOI provides each party with the opportunity to conduct

an inspection of the other party?s respective business prior to

closing.  The Company has agreed not to entertain, solicit or

encourage any inquiries, discussions or proposals for the

acquisition of the Company or to enter into any agreement,

understanding or arrangement pertaining to the merger or

consolidation of the Company or the sale of its securities to any

party other than Longdan for a period of 120 days after the

signing of the LOI, subject to certain fiduciary considerations.

Longdan has agreed that the general partner of the Company

shall not be personally liable with respect to the LOI or any

definitive agreement and has agreed not to bring any action or

proceeding in any court, regulatory agency or other tribunal

against the general partner in his individual capacity seeking

damages or other relief against the general partner personally.

(a) On February 2, 2005, the Registrant consummated a third and final closing in

its private placement of securities (the ""Private Placement"") previously

reported on the Registrant's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 26,

2005 (the ""January 26, 2005 8-K""). In the final closing on February 2, 2005, the

Registrant sold an additional 2,906,500 shares (the ""Shares"") of its common

stock (the ""Common Stock"") to investors in the Private Placement. The Registrant

sold a total of 9,995,250 Shares in the Private Placement and raised $19,990,500

in the aggregate. The January 26, 2005 8-K, including the Exhibits filed

therewith, are specifically incorporated herein by reference. The Registrant

reasonably believes that the securities were sold only to ""accredited

investors"", as such term is defined under Rule 501(e) under Regulation D

promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Act""). The

Registrant sold the Shares at the February 2, 2005 closing at a gross price of

$2.00 per Share, or $5,813,000 in the aggregate. The Registrant also issued one

Common Stock purchase warrant (each one, a ""Warrant"") to purchase one share of

the Common Stock to each investor for every two shares of Common Stock purchased

in the Private Placement. The Registrant issued to the investors at the February

2, 2005 closing, in the aggregate, Warrants to purchase 1,453,250 shares of

Common Stock (the shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrants, the ""Warrant

Shares""). The Shares and the Warrants were sold by the Registrant to the

investors pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement dated December 31, 2004

(the ""Agreement""), described in the January 26, 2005 8-K. The Agreement was

filed as Exhibit 10.5 to the January 26, 2005 8-K, which is specifically

incorporated herein by reference. On January 27, 2005, the Registrant and a

majority-in-interest of the investors in the Private Placement to date amended

the Agreement. Prior to the amendment (the ""Amendment""), the Agreement provided

for the sale of up to 7,000,000 Shares and a possible overallotment of up to ten

percent (10%) at the Registrant's sole discretion, together with corresponding

Warrants, through a final closing no later than January 30, 2005 (pursuant to an

extension at the Registrant's sole option). The Amendment filed as Exhibit 10.9

to this Current Report on Form 8-K increased the number of Shares which the

Registrant may sell in the Private Placement to 10,000,000 Shares inclusive of

the Shares sold in the Private Placement to date, with no overallotment option,,

and allowed the Registrant to extend the final closing date to February 2, 2005.

In connection with the February 2, 2005 closing of the sale of Shares, the

Registrant paid a cash fee to placement agents in the amount of $555,800, which

is equal to ten percent (10%) of the aggregate gross proceeds to the Registrant

from the sale on February 2, 2005 of Shares to investors introduced to the

Registrant by the placement agents. In addition, the Registrant incurred a

non-accountable expense allowance to the lead placement agent, paid in cash at

the February 2, 2005 closing, amounting to $111,060, which is equal to three

percent (3%) of the gross sales price of the Shares (but not any Warrant Shares)

sold at the February 2, 2005 closing to investors introduced by the lead

placement agent (without duplication of introduction), such 3% amount being

sometimes hereafter referred to as the ""Non-Accountable Expense Allowance. In

addition, the Registrant issued to each placement agent Common Stock purchase

warrants (each one, a ""Placement Agent Warrant"") to purchase shares of Common

Stock (the shares of Common Stock underlying the Placement Agent Warrants, the

""Placement Agent Warrant Shares""). The Registrant issued to the placement

agents, in the aggregate, Placement Agent Warrants to purchase 297,900 Placement

Agent Warrant Shares, which number of shares of Common Stock is equal to ten

percent (10%) of the number of Shares (but not Warrant Shares) sold at the

February 2, 2005 closing to investors introduced by the placement agents

(without duplication of introduction). The Registrant has agreed to indemnify

its placement agents against certain liabilities. The Registrant also agreed to

pay its own costs of the Private Placement.

The Warrants sold to investors in the Private Placement shall initially be

exercisable at $3.00 per share of Common Stock, subject to adjustment,

commencing one year after the date of issuance and continuing for three (3)

years thereafter; provided that unexercised Warrants expire earlier ten (10)

days after written notice from the Registrant that the market price of the

Common Stock has equaled or exceeded 400% of the then applicable exercise price

of the applicable Warrants for a period of at least 30 days, and the average

trading volume of the Common Stock has been at least 100,000 shares per day

during the preceding thirty (30) days. The Warrants are not transferable. The

Placement Agent Warrants shall initially be exercisable at $2.00 per share of

Common Stock, subject to adjustment, commencing one year after the date of

issuance and continuing for five (5) years thereafter; provided that unexercised

Warrants expire earlier ten (10) days after written notice from the Registrant

that the market price of the Common Stock has equaled or exceeded 400% of the

then applicable exercise price of the applicable Warrants for a period of at

least 30 days, and the average trading volume of the Common Stock has been at

least 100,000 shares per day during the preceding thirty (30) days. The

Placement Agent Warrants also contain a cashless exercise provision. The

Placement Agent Warrants are transferable by the placement agent receiving the

same to its officers, directors, shareholders and employees, as well as by such

persons to their immediate family affiliates in connection with estate planning,

provided that no such transfer or disposition may be made other than in

compliance with applicable securities laws and furnishing satisfactory evidence

of such compliance to the Registrant. The Warrants, the Placement Agent

Warrants, the Warrant Shares and the Placement Agent Warrant Shares are

""restricted securities"" and, therefore, may be transferred, to the extent

permissible, only pursuant to registration or qualification under federal and

state securities laws or pursuant to an exemption from registration or

qualification. The terms and conditions of the Warrants and the Placement Agent

Warrants are incorporated herein by reference.

In connection with the closing, the Registrant entered into a Registration

Rights Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.6 to the January 26, 2005 8-K,

which is specifically incorporated herein by reference. The Registration Rights

Agreement imposes certain registration obligations upon the Registrant with

respect to the Shares acquired in the Private Placement by each investor who

executes and delivers to the Registrant the Registration Rights Agreement. The

Registration Rights Agreement also grants certain registration rights in favor

such investors with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying Warrants

received by them in the Private Placement. Placement agents who execute and

deliver the Registration Rights Agreement to the Registrant shall have similar

rights with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying Placement Agent

Warrants. The shares with respect to which the Registration Rights Agreement

grants such rights are referred to as ""Registrable Securities"", and shall

continue to be Registrable Securities until those shares have either been

effectively registered under the Act and disposed of in accordance with a

registration statement covering them, (y) have been sold to the public pursuant

to Rule 144 or by similar provision under the Act, or (z) are eligible for

resale under Rule 144(k) or by similar provision under the Act without any

limitation on the amount of securities that may be sold under paragraph (e)

thereof.

Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Registrant is required to use

its reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following:

(x) prepare and file a registration statement covering the Common Shares and the

Warrant Shares (a ""Required Registration Statement"") with the U.S. Securities

and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") by the date (the ""Required Filing Date"")

which is not more than sixty (60) days after the first date to occur (the

""Commencement Date"") of the following dates: the Final Closing Date (as such

term is defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement) or the termination of the

Offering, if there is no Final Closing Date; and (y) cause either of the

following (the ""Effectiveness Actions"") to occur by a date (the ""Required

Effectiveness Date"") which is not more than one hundred and twenty (120) days

after the Commencement Date: (A) cause the SEC to declare the Required

Registration Statement to be effective or (B) cause the SEC to communicate to

the Registrant, orally or in writing, that the Required Registration Statement

will not be reviewed or that the Commission has no further comments thereupon,

whereupon the Registrant shall cause the Required Registration Statement to be

effective.

Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the failure to file or become

effective within the applicable time period shall be deemed to be a

""Non-Registration Event"". For each thirty (30) day period during the pendency of

any such Non-Registration Event, the Registrant shall deliver to each investor

in the Private Placement, as liquidated damages, an amount equal to one and

one-half percent (1.5%) of the aggregate purchase price paid by such investor

for Shares, with such payment being pro-rated for any Non-Registration Event of

less than thirty (30) days. Each such payment is hereinafter referred to as a

""Non-Registration Event Penalty Payment"". Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no

event shall the Registrant be obligated to pay more than one Non-Registration

Event Penalty Payment to the same Purchaser in respect of a substantively

concurrent failure to perform. The Registrant, at its sole discretion, shall pay

the Non-Registration Event Penalty Payment to all holders in cash or in shares

of its Common Stock.

The Registrant agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to keep such Required

Registration Statement continuously effective (the ""Effective Period"") for a

period of two years after the Required Registration Statement first becomes

effective plus whatever period of time as shall equal any period, if any, during

such one year period in which the Registrant was not current with its reporting

requirements under the Exchange Act.

To the extent the Registrable Securities are not sold under the Required

Registration Statement, the investors in the Private Placement shall have the

following registration rights pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement:

If the Registrant is eligible to use Form S-3 under the Act (or any similar

successor form) and shall receive from the holders of the Common Shares and any

permitted transferees (the ""S-3 Initiating Holders"") a written request that the

Registrant effect a registration on such Form S-3 pursuant to Rule 415 of the

Act and any related qualification or compliance with respect to all or part of

the Registrable Securities owned by the S-3 Initiating Holders (provided, that

the S-3 Initiating Holders registering Registrable Securities in such

registration (together with all other holders of Registrable Securities to be

included in such registration) propose to sell their Registrable Securities at

an aggregate price (calculated based upon the Market Price of the Registrable

Securities on the date of filing of the Form S-3 with respect to such

Registrable Securities) to the public of no less than $6,000,000), the

Registrant shall (i) promptly give written notice of the proposed registration,

and any related qualification or compliance, to all other holders of Registrable

Securities; and (ii) as soon as practicable, use reasonable best efforts to file

and effect such registration and all such qualifications and compliances as may

be so reasonably requested and as would permit or facilitate the sale and

distribution of all or such portion of the Registrable Securities as are

specified in such request, together with all or such portion of the Registrable

Securities of any other holder in the group of holders joining in such request

as is specified in a written request given within 15 days after the holder's

receipt of such written notice from the Registrant.

In addition, for so long as the Registration Rights Agreement shall be

applicable, whenever the Registrant proposes to register any of its securities

under the Act (other than pursuant to any of the registration rights described

above, or a registration on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor or similar forms)

and the registration form to be used may be used for the registration of

Registrable Securities, whether or not for sale for its own account, the

Registrant will give prompt written notice (but in no event less than 15 days

before the anticipated filing date) to all holders of Registrable Securities,

and such notice shall describe the proposed registration and distribution and

offer to all holders of Registrable Securities the opportunity to register the

number of Registrable Securities as each such holder may request. The Registrant

will include in such registration all Registrable Securities with respect to

which the Registrant has received written requests for inclusion therein within

10 days after the holders' receipt of the Registrant's notice. The Registrant

shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the managing underwriter of a proposed

underwritten offering to permit the Registrable Securities requested to be

included in a piggyback registration to be included on the same terms and

conditions as any similar securities of any other security holder included

therein and to permit the sale or other disposition of such Registrable

Securities in accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof.

The performance of these registration rights is subject to customary investor

representations and warranties, customary indemnifications by investors,

customary allocations of fees and expenses and, where applicable, customary

cutback and blackout provisions.

Bluetorch  Inc.  to  ""Pacific  Crest  Investments.""

As

previously disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"")

on November 1, 2016, Surna Inc. (the ""Company"") has been privately negotiating with certain holders of certain 10%

convertible promissory notes (the ""Original Notes"") and warrants (the ""Original Warrants"" and together

with the Original Notes, the ""Original Securities"") with a view to amending and converting the Original Notes and

amending the terms of the Original Warrants.

The

Original Securities were issued as part of a unit (each unit consisted of 250,000 shares of Common Stock, an Original Warrant

to purchase 50,000 shares of Common Stock and an Original Note in the principal amount of $50,000) to investors participating

in the Company's private placement financing that completed closings between October 31, 2014 and February 27, 2015. The

Original Notes mature and become payable two years from issuance.

As

of December 6, 2016, the Company has entered into Note Conversion and Warrant Amendment Agreements (each, an ""Agreement""

and together, the ""Agreements"") with each of 33 holders, to: (i) amend the Original Note (each an ""Amended Note"")

to reduce the conversion price of such holder's Original Note and simultaneously cause the conversion of the outstanding

amount under such Original Note into shares of Common Stock of the Company (""Conversion Shares""); and (ii) reduce

the exercise price of the Original Warrant (each, an ""Amended Warrant"" and together with an Amended Note, the ""Amendments"").

Each Agreement has been privately negotiated so the terms may vary. Pursuant to the Agreements, the Original Notes have been amended

to reflect a reduced conversion price per share between $0.12 and $0.16. Additionally, pursuant to the Agreements ,  certain

Original Warrants have been amended to reflect a reduced exercise price per share of $0.35, with the exception of the first

Agreement signed which amended certain Original Warrants to reflect a reduced exercise price of $0.15

per share.

Pursuant

to the Agreements, the Company has (i) converted Original Notes with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of approximately

$1,475,000, or approximately 60% of the total principal amount under the Original Notes, (ii) issued 12,220,604 Conversion Shares

in connection with the conversion of such Original Notes and (iii) amended 1,425,000 Original Warrants. All of the holders party

to the Note Conversion and Warrant Amendment Agreements were ""accredited investors"" as such term is defined in Rule

501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act"").

In

connection with the Amendments, the Company has also negotiated with some of the holders a restriction that limits the number

of Conversion Shares a holder may sell, make any short sale of, loan, grant any option for the purchase of, or otherwise dispose

of any of such shares issuable in connection with the Amendments without the prior written consent of the Company for a period

of ninety (90) days after the date of such holder's Agreement.

The Company intends to negotiate with

the remaining holders of the Original Notes to convert the remaining $1,061,000 of principal; however, it cannot make any assurance

that it will be successful in converting any more Original Notes.

foregoing summary of the Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreements, a copy of which

As disclosed previously, as a special purpose acquisition company prior to its business combination with WSII in November 2017, the Company was required to demonstrate compliance with the initial listing requirements for The Nasdaq Capital Market following the business combination. In January 2018, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ( Nasdaq ) indicating that the Companys common stock complies with the initial requirements for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, whereas the Companys warrants did not comply with the minimum 400 round lot holder requirement set forth in Listing Rule 5515(a)(4). For purposes of the initial listing requirements for warrants, a round lot holder is an investor that owns at least 100 warrants.

The Company timely requested a hearing to explore the possibility of staying a delisting action. On February 20, 2018, a Nasdaq Hearings Panel granted the Companys request for an extension of time to demonstrate compliance by July 3, 2018.

On July 10, 2018, the Company was notified of the Nasdaq Hearings Panels determination to delist the warrants based on the Companys failure to demonstrate compliance by the July 3 deadline. Trading for the Companys warrants was suspended at the opening of business on July 12, 2018, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to remove the warrants from listing and registration on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

The Company expects that its warrants will be eligible to be traded over-the-counter. However, no assurance can be given that trading of the warrants will be commenced or maintained on an over-the-counter market or any other quotation medium.

This action does not affect the listing of the Companys class A common stock (Nasdaq: WSC).

As previously disclosed by Industrial Property Trust Inc. (the Company) in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange

and, together with the General Partner, the IPT Partners) are partners in the Build-To-Core Industrial Partnership I LP (the BTC Partnership). As disclosed in the Prior Report, the IPT Partners own a 51% interest in the BTC

Partnership and third party limited partners (collectively, the Third Party Partner) own the remaining 49% interest in the BTC Partnership. The Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the BTC Partnership (the BTC

Partnership Agreement) sets forth the terms pursuant to which the BTC Partnership intends to invest in a portfolio of industrial properties located in certain major United States distribution markets, and to be comprised of approximately

(i) 80% development investments and (ii) 20% core investments and value-add investments.    Pursuant to the BTC Partnership Agreement, the General

Partner will provide, directly or indirectly by appointing an affiliate or a third party, acquisition and asset management services and, to the extent applicable, development management and development oversight services (the Advisory

Services). As compensation for providing the Advisory Services, the BTC Partnership will pay the General Partner, or its designee, certain fees in accordance with the terms of the BTC Partnership Agreement. On April 10, 2015, the General

Partner and Industrial Property Advisors LLC (the Advisor), the advisor to the Company, entered into an amended and restated agreement, effective as of February 12, 2015 (the Services Agreement), pursuant to which the

General Partner has appointed the Advisor to provide the Advisory Services and has assigned to the Advisor the fees payable pursuant to the BTC Partnership Agreement for providing the Advisory Services. As a result of the payment of the fees

pursuant to the Services Agreement, the fees payable to the Advisor pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, dated as of July 16, 2014, by and among the Company, the Advisor and Industrial Property Operating Partnership

LP (the Advisory Agreement) will be reduced by the product of (i) the fees actually paid to the Advisor pursuant to the Services Agreement, and (ii) the percentage interest of the BTC Partnership owned by the IPT Partners. In

addition, the BTC Partnership Agreement contains procedures for making distributions to the parties, including incentive distributions to the General Partner, which are subject to certain return thresholds being achieved. The General Partner has

agreed to share with the Advisor a portion of any incentive distributions paid to the General Partner by the BTC Partnership in an amount equal to 40% of the percentage interest of the BTC Partnership held by partners other than the IPT Partners.

Further, the Services Agreement provides that it will terminate upon termination of the Advisory Agreement with the exception that if the Advisory Agreement is terminated other than for cause, the Advisor shall have the right, in its

sole discretion, to require the General Partner to seek the consent of the Third Party Partner to sell 50% of the General Partners general partner interest in the BTC Partnership to the Advisor for the fair market value of the interest. In

such event, the General Partner will seek the Third Party Partners consent to the sale and the admission of the Advisor as an administrative general partner of the BTC Partnership. If the Advisor is made the administrative general partner,

then the Services Agreement will terminate and the Advisor will continue to provide the BTC Advisory Services and receive the same fees and the same portion of any incentive distributions as those to which the Advisor was entitled under the Services

Agreement prior to its termination, but the Advisor will not control or manage the BTC Partnership. If the Third Party Partner does not provide its consent or if the Advisor determines not to purchase the interest, then the Services Agreement will

terminate.    Forward-Looking Statements    This Current

Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements (such as those concerning the potential future activities of the BTC Partnership) that are based on the Companys current expectations, plans, estimates, assumptions and beliefs that

these forward-looking statements reflect managements belief as to future events, actual events or the Companys investments and results of operations could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking

statements. To the extent that the Companys assumptions differ from actual results, the Companys ability to meet such forward-looking statements may be significantly hindered. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any

appointing an affiliate or a third party, acquisition and asset management services and, to the extent applicable, development management and development oversight services (the Advisory Services). As compensation for providing the

Advisory Services, the BTC Partnership will pay the General Partner, or its designee, certain fees in accordance with the terms of the BTC Partnership Agreement. On February 12, 2015, the General Partner and Industrial Property Advisors LLC

(the Advisor), the advisor to the Company, entered into that certain agreement (the Services Agreement), pursuant to which the General Partner appointed the Advisor to provide the Advisory Services and has assigned to the

Advisor the fees payable pursuant to the BTC Partnership Agreement for providing the Advisory Services. As a result of the payment of the fees pursuant to the Services Agreement, the fees payable to the Advisor pursuant to that certain Amended and

Restated Advisory Agreement, dated as of July 16, 2014, by and among the Company, the Advisor and Industrial Property Operating Partnership LP (the Advisory Agreement) will be reduced by the product of (i) the fees actually

paid to the Advisor pursuant to the Services Agreement, and (ii) the percentage interest of the BTC Partnership owned by the IPT Partners. Accordingly, the aggregate of all fees paid to the Advisor for providing Advisory Services to the BTC

Partnership will not exceed the aggregate amounts otherwise payable to the Advisor pursuant to the Advisory Agreement.    In addition, the BTC Partnership

Agreement contains procedures for making distributions to the parties, including incentive distributions to the General Partner, which are subject to certain return thresholds being achieved. The General Partner has agreed to share with the Advisor

a portion of any incentive distributions paid to the General Partner by the BTC Partnership in an amount equal to 40% of the percentage interest of the BTC Partnership held by partners other than the IPT Partners.

Forward-Looking Statements    This Current Report on Form

8-K contains forward-looking statements (such as those concerning the potential future payments to the Advisor and distributions to the General Partner by the BTC Partnership) that are based on the Companys current expectations, plans,

estimates, assumptions, and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those risks set forth in the Risk Factors section of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 2013, as amended or supplemented by the Companys other filings with the SEC. Although these forward looking statements reflect managements belief as to future events, actual events or the Companys investments and

actual results of operations could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward looking statements. To the extent that the Companys assumptions differ from actual results, the Companys ability to meet such

forward-looking statements may be significantly hindered. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. The Company cannot assure you that it will attain its investment objectives.

Cautionary Statement about the Monthly Operating Report

The Company cautions investors and potential investors not to place undue reliance upon the information contained in the Monthly Operating Report, which was not

prepared for the purpose of providing the basis for an investment decision relating to any of the securities of the Company. The Monthly Operating Report is limited in scope, covers a limited time period and has been prepared solely for the purpose

of complying with the monthly reporting requirements of the Bankruptcy Court. The Monthly Operating Report was not audited or reviewed by independent accountants, was not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the

United States, is in a format prescribed by applicable bankruptcy laws or rules, and is subject to future adjustment and reconciliation. There can be no assurance that, from the perspective of an investor or potential investor in the Company's

securities, the Monthly Operating Report is complete. Results set forth in the Monthly Operating Report should not be viewed as indicative of future results.

Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements

Various statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including those that express a belief, expectation or intention, as well as those that are not

statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company's actual results may differ

materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain risks and other factors, which include the following: risks and uncertainties relating to the Chapter 11 Cases, including but not limited to, the terms of

and potential transactions contemplated by the Second Amended Plan, the Plan Supplement and Amended Disclosure Statement, including the timing of the filing by the Company of a Form 15 with the SEC, the Company's ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court

approval with respect to motions in the Chapter 11 Cases, the effects of the Chapter 11 Cases on the Company and on the interests of various constituents, Bankruptcy Court rulings in the Chapter 11 Cases and the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases in

general, the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, risks associated with third-party motions in the Chapter 11 Cases, and the Company's ability to realize proceeds from remaining assets; risks related to the trading of the Company's common stock on the

OTC Pink Market, particularly because the Second Amended Plan provides that there will not be sufficient funds or other assets to allow holders of the Company's common stock to receive any distribution of value in respect of their equity interests;

the uncertainty as to when or whether the effective date of the Second Amended Plan will occur as currently expected by the Company; and the risk that the Chapter 11 Cases may be converted to cases under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code; as well as

other risk factors set forth in the Amended Disclosure Statement included as Exhibit 99.2 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on November 9, 2020 with the SEC. The Company therefore cautions readers against relying on

these forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or persons acting on the Company's behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements. All such statements speak only

as of the date made, and, except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.",FALSE

If such

interest payments are not made within the 30-day grace period provided by each

of the governing Indentures, an event of default would occur under the

indentures governing the notes, permitting holders of at least 25% in principal

amount of any outstanding series of notes on which the interest payment was not

made  to declare the full amount of the applicable notes immediately

due and payable.

An event

of default on the notes, without such an acceleration of amounts due under the

notes, would not trigger cross-defaults on any of the other debt of the

subsidiaries of the Company.  If payment is not made with respect to

any series of notes within the 30-day grace period, and the notes are

accelerated, all amounts due with respect to such affected notes become

immediately due and payable.  If notes issued by the Company or any of

its subsidiaries accelerate, and such notes, together with the amount of any

other notes of the Company or any of its subsidiaries that accelerate, represent

$100 million or more in principal amount, events of default would occur under

other debt instruments of the Company or certain of its subsidiaries which could

lead to the acceleration of indebtedness under such documents.

On

December 12, 2008, the Company announced that it was initiating discussions with

its bondholders regarding financial alternatives to improve the Company's

balance sheet.  As of January 13, 2009, the Company had cash on hand

and cash equivalents in excess of $900 million, which is available to pay

operating costs and expenses.

CLO Transaction Overview

On

December 5, 2019 (the ""Closing Date""), FS Credit Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (the ""Company"")

closed on a new source of debt financing totally  approximately $327.7 million through the issuance of a collateralized loan

obligation (the ""CLO Transaction""). The notes offered in the CLO Transaction were issued through the

Company's newly-formed subsidiary real estate investment trust, FS Rialto Sub-REIT LLC (""Sub-REIT""), and

two wholly-owned financing subsidiaries of Sub-REIT, FS Rialto 2019-FL1 Issuer, Ltd., a newly incorporated exempted company

with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands, as issuer (the ""Issuer""), and FS Rialto 2019-FL1

Co-Issuer, LLC, a newly-formed Delaware limited liability company, as co-issuer (the

""Co-Issuer"" and, together with the Issuer, the ""CLO Issuers"").

On

the Closing Date, the CLO Issuers issued four classes of notes, the Class A Notes, the Class A-S Notes, the Class B Notes

and the Class C Notes  (the ""Offered Notes""), and the Issuer issued an additional three classes of notes, the

Class D Notes, Class E Notes and the Class F Notes, each in the principal amount and having the characteristics and

designations set forth in the table and description below (together with the Offered Notes, the ""Notes"").

In addition, concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer issued 45,288.127 Preferred Shares, par value $0.001

per share, and with an aggregate liquidation preference equal to $1,000 per share (the ""Preferred Shares""

and, together with the Notes, the ""Securities"").

The

CLO Issuers issued or co-issued the Notes, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of an indenture, dated as of the Closing

Date (the ""Indenture""), by and among the CLO Issuers, the Company, as advancing agent (in such capacity, together with

its permitted successors and assigns, the ""Advancing Agent""), Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the

""Trustee""), and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as note administrator and custodian (the ""Note Administrator"").

The Note Administrator will also act as paying agent, calculation agent, transfer agent, backup advancing agent and notes registrar

for the Issuer. The Company will serve as the collateral manager for the Issuer (in such capacity, the ""Collateral Manager"").

A copy of the Indenture is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

(1)

The initial weighted average life of each class of Notes has been calculated assuming certain collateral characteristics, including that there are no prepayments, defaults or delinquencies and certain other modeling assumptions. In addition, it is assumed that each commercial real estate loan pays off on its current maturity date without extension. There can be no assurances that such assumptions will be met.

(2)

The fully extended weighted average life of each class of Notes has been calculated assuming certain collateral characteristics, including that there are no prepayments, defaults or delinquencies and certain other modeling assumptions. In addition, it is assumed that each commercial real estate loan pays is fully extended to its maximum contracted extension term. There can be no assurances that such assumptions will be met.

The

Notes will mature at par on the payment date in December 2036, unless redeemed or repaid prior thereto.

The

Indenture allows for the exchange of all or a portion of certain classes of Notes for proportionate interests in one or more classes

of certain other notes, as further explained under the heading "" Exchangeable Notes "" below.

The

Offered Notes were placed pursuant to a Placement Agreement, dated as of November 18, 2019, by and among the Issuer, the Co-Issuer,

the Company, the Seller, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC. The retention holder, which is an indirect

wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Sub-REIT, acquired 100% of the Class D Notes, the

Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Preferred Shares issued on the Closing Date.

The

Offered Notes represent limited recourse obligations of the Issuer and non-recourse obligations of the Co-Issuer payable solely

from certain collateral interests acquired by the Issuer on and after the Closing Date and pledged under the Indenture. To the

extent the collateral is insufficient to make payments in respect of the Offered Notes, none of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, any

of their respective affiliates or any other person will have any obligation to pay any further amounts in respect of the Offered

Notes. The Class E Notes and the Class F Notes are not secured.

The

Preferred Shares are subject to the terms and conditions of a Preferred Share Paying Agency Agreement, dated as of the Closing

Date, among the Issuer, Wells Fargo Bank, as paying agent and transfer agent, and Maples FS Limited, as Preferred Share registrar.

The Preferred Shares have no stated dividend rate. The holders of the Preferred Shares are entitled to receive monthly non-cumulative

dividends on each payment date if and to the extent that funds are available for such purpose in accordance with the priority of

payments and Cayman Islands law. Such dividends will be payable only to the extent of the Issuer's distributable profits

and/or share premium and only if the Issuer is and will remain solvent after such distributions are paid (each factor determined

in accordance with Cayman Islands law). In addition, the holders of the Preferred Shares will be entitled to receive distributions

in connection with the redemption thereof, payable from the collateral after payment of all specified amounts in accordance with

the priority of payments and Cayman Islands law.

The

Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), or any state

securities laws, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from,

or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.

The

proceeds from the issuance of the Securities on the Closing Date, after payment of certain fees and expenses, were used to (i)

purchase an initial portfolio of collateral interests, (ii) fund the unused proceeds account for the purchase of additional collateral

interests, (iii) repay amounts owed in respect of certain pre- Closing Date financings and (iv) undertake certain related activities.

The

initial portfolio of collateral interests was purchased by the Issuer from FS CREIT Finance Holdings LLC (the ""Seller"")

pursuant to a Collateral Interest Purchase Agreement (the ""Collateral Interest Purchase Agreement""), dated as of the

Closing Date, by and among the Issuer, the Seller, the Company and, solely with regard to certain tax covenants, Sub-REIT. Pursuant

to the Collateral Interest Purchase Agreement, the Seller made certain representations and warranties to the Issuer with respect

to the collateral interests. In the event that a material breach of a representation or warranty or document defect with respect

to any collateral interest exists, the Seller will have to either (a) correct or cure such breach of representation or warranty

or document defect in all material respects, within 90 days (or as such time may be extended under the Collateral Interest Purchase

Agreement) of discovery by the Seller or any party to the Indenture (to the extent such breach is capable of being corrected or

cured), (b) make a cash payment to the Issuer in an amount that the Special Servicer (as defined below) determines is sufficient

to compensate the Issuer or (c) repurchase such collateral interest at a repurchase price calculated as set forth in the Collateral

Interest Purchase Agreement. The obligation of the Seller to repurchase a collateral interest in connection with a material breach

of a representation or warranty or a document defect pursuant to the Collateral Interest Purchase Agreement has been guaranteed

by the Company.

The

Notes

Collateral

The

Offered Notes will be secured by, among other things, (i) the commercial mortgage loans and participation interests in commercial

mortgage loans acquired by the Issuer on the Closing Date and thereafter from time to time in accordance with the terms of the

Indenture, (ii) the collection account, the participated loan collection account, the payment account, the unused proceeds account,

the custodial account and the related security entitlements and all income from the investment of funds in any of the foregoing

at any time credited to any of the foregoing accounts, (iii) the eligible investments purchased from deposits in certain accounts,

(iv) the Issuer's rights under certain agreements (including the Collateral Management Agreement, the Collateral Interest

Purchase Agreement and the Servicing Agreement, each as defined herein), (v) all amounts delivered to the Note Administrator or

its bailee (directly or through a securities intermediary), (vi) all other investment property, instruments and general intangibles

in which the Issuer has an interest, (vii) the Issuer's ownership interests in and rights in all permitted subsidiaries and

(viii) all proceeds of the foregoing (collectively, the ""Collateral""); however, the Collateral will not include, and

the Offered Notes will not be secured by, any interests in certain excepted property enumerated in the Indenture.

Maturity

The

Notes will mature at par on the payment date in December 2036, unless redeemed or repaid prior thereto.

Interest

Rate

For

purposes of the below, ""Benchmark"" means, initially, one-month LIBOR; provided that if LIBOR or the then-current alternative

benchmark is replaced, then ""Benchmark"" means the applicable replacement.

Class

A Notes . The Class A Notes will bear interest during each interest accrual period at a per annum rate equal to the sum of (a)

the Benchmark plus (b)(i) with respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period), 1.200% plus, (ii) with respect

to each payment date (and related interest accrual period) on and after the payment date in October 2025, 0.25%.

Class

A-S Notes . The Class A-S Notes will bear interest during each interest accrual period at a per annum rate equal to the sum

of (a) the Benchmark plus, (b)(i) with respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period), 1.4500% plus, (ii) with

respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period) on and after the payment date in October 2025, 0.25%.

Class

B Notes . The Class B Notes will bear interest during each interest accrual period at a per annum rate equal to the sum of (a)

the Benchmark plus, (b)(i) with respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period), 1.900% plus, (ii) with respect

to each payment date (and related interest accrual period) on and after the payment date in October 2025, 0.50%.

Class

C Notes . The Class C Notes will bear interest during each interest accrual period at a per annum rate equal to the sum of (a)

the Benchmark plus, (b)(i) with respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period), 2.500% plus, (ii) with respect

to each payment date (and related interest accrual period) on and after the payment date in October 2025, 0.50%.

Class

D Notes . The Class D Notes will bear interest during each interest accrual period at a per annum rate equal to the sum of (a)

the Benchmark plus, (b)(i) with respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period), 2.800% plus, (ii) with respect

to each payment date (and related interest accrual period) on and after the payment date in October 2025, 0.50%.

Class

E Notes . The Class E Notes will bear interest during each interest accrual period at a per annum rate equal to the sum of (a)

the Benchmark plus, (b)(i) with respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period), 4.500% plus, (ii) with respect

to each payment date (and related interest accrual period) on and after the payment date in January 2022, 0.50%.

Class

F Notes . The Class F Notes will bear interest during each interest accrual period at a per annum rate equal to the sum of (a)

the Benchmark plus, (b)(i) with respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period), 6.000% plus, (ii) with respect

to each payment date (and related interest accrual period) on and after the payment date in January 2022, 0.50%.

Interest

on the Notes will be calculated based on the actual number of days in the related interest accrual period, assuming a 360-day year.

The

failure to pay interest on the Class A Notes, the Class A-S Notes or the Class B Notes at any time or, if no Class A Notes, Class

A-S Notes or Class B Notes are outstanding, on any other class of Notes at the time such class of Notes is the most senior class

of Notes outstanding, will constitute an event of default under the Indenture (following any applicable grace period).

For

so long as any class of Notes with a higher priority is outstanding, any interest due on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes,

the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes that is not paid as a result of the operation of the priority of payments on any payment

date (any such interest, ""Deferred Interest"") will be deferred, will not be considered ""due and payable""

and the failure to pay such Deferred Interest will not be an event of default under the Indenture. Any Deferred Interest will be

added to the outstanding principal balance of such class of Notes.

Principal

payments on each class of Notes will be paid in accordance with the priority of payments set forth in the Indenture.

Exchangeable Notes

The

Indenture allows for the exchange of all or a portion of the Class E Notes and the Class F Notes, as follows: (i) the Class E Notes

may be exchanged for proportionate interests in the Class E-E Notes (as defined in the Indenture) and the Class E-X Notes (as defined

in the Indenture) and (ii) the Class F Notes may be exchanged for proportionate interests in the Class F-E Notes (as defined in

the Indenture) and the Class F-X Notes (as defined in the Indenture), in the manner set forth in the Indenture.

Subordination

of the Notes

In

general, payments of interest and principal on any class of Notes are subordinate to all payments of interest and principal on

any class of Notes with a more senior priority. Generally, all payments on the Notes will be subordinate to certain payments required

to be made in respect of any interest advances and certain other expenses. Payments on the Notes will be senior to any payments

on or in respect of the Preferred Shares to the extent required by the priority of payments set forth in the Indenture.

Note Protection Tests

The

Notes are subject to note protection tests (the ""Note Protection Tests""), which will be used primarily to determine

whether and to what extent interest received on the collateral interests may be used to make certain payments subordinate to interest

and principal payments to the Offered Notes in the priority of payments set forth in the Indenture.

If

either of the Note Protection Tests are not satisfied as of any determination date, then on the next payment date, interest proceeds

will be used to redeem the Offered Notes in accordance with the priority of payments until such Note Protection Tests are satisfied.

The

following chart specifies the minimum ratios required for each Note Protection Test to be satisfied for the Notes.

Note Protection Test

Ratio

Minimum Par Value

115.98 %

Minimum Interest Coverage

120.00 %

The

par value ratio is, as of any measurement date, the number (expressed as a percentage) calculated by dividing (a) the net outstanding

portfolio balance on such measurement date by (b) the sum of the aggregate outstanding amount of the Class A Notes, the Class A-S

Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes and the amount of any unreimbursed interest advances.

The

interest coverage ratio is generally equal to the interest proceeds from the collateral portfolio divided by the interest payable

on the Offered Notes.

Collateral

Management Agreement

Pursuant

to a Collateral Management Agreement, dated as of December 5, 2019, between the Issuer and the Company (the ""Collateral Management

Agreement""), the Company will serve as collateral manager for the CLO Issuers.

As

compensation for the performance of its obligations as Collateral Manager, the Collateral Manager is entitled to receive a fee,

payable monthly in arrears, equal to (unless waived) 0.10% per annum of the sum of the net outstanding portfolio balance to the

extent funds are available. The Company has agreed to waive its entitlement to such Collateral Manager fee for so long as the Company

or an affiliate is the Collateral Manager.

The

Collateral Manager may be removed upon at least 30 days' prior written notice by the Issuer or the Trustee, if (i) certain

events of default have occurred by the Collateral Manager and (ii) if the holders of at least 66-2/3% in aggregate outstanding

amount of each class of Notes then outstanding give written notice to the Collateral Manager, the Issuer and the Trustee directing

such removal. The Collateral Manager cannot be removed without cause but may resign as Collateral Manager upon 90 days' prior

written notice. Upon any resignation or removal of the Collateral Manager while any of the Notes are outstanding, holders of a

majority of the Preferred Shares (excluding any Preferred Shares held by certain related parties) will have the right to instruct

the Issuer to appoint an institution identified by such holders as replacement Collateral Manager. In the event that (i) 100% of

the aggregate outstanding Preferred Shares are held by related parties, (ii) the proposed replacement Collateral Manager is an

affiliate of the Collateral Manager, and (iii) the appointment of the proposed replacement Collateral Manager would constitute

an ""assignment"" under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the holders of at least a majority of the aggregate outstanding

principal balance of the most junior class of Notes not 100% owned by related parties (excluding any Notes held by related parties

to the extent the replacement Collateral Manager is an affiliate of the Collateral Manager or the Collateral Manager has been removed

after the occurrence of an event of default) may direct the Issuer to appoint an institution identified by such holders as replacement

Collateral Manager.

Except

with respect to the limitations set forth in the Indenture, the Collateral Manager is not obligated to pursue any particular investment

strategy or opportunity with respect to the collateral interests.

Reinvestment

and Ramp-Up Periods

The

CLO Transaction includes (i) a ramp-up period (unless no funds remain to purchase additional collateral interests or the Collateral

Manager otherwise determines to terminate the ramp-up period) starting on the Closing Date and ending on the sixth payment date

(the ""Ramp-Up Period"") and (ii) a 24-month reinvestment period (unless all of the Notes are redeemed or an event

of default occurs before such date) (the ""Reinvestment Period""). During each such periods, the Issuer may acquire additional

(a) commercial mortgage loans or (b) participation interests in commercial mortgage loans, using, (i) during the Ramp-Up Period,

proceeds from the issuance of the Securities, and (ii) during the Reinvestment Period, interest, principal, and sale proceeds from

the collateral portfolio and certain other proceeds, as set forth in the Indenture.

The

Servicing Agreement

Except

for certain non-serviced loans, the commercial real estate loans will be serviced by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association,

as servicer (the ""Servicer""), and Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC, as special servicer (the ""Special Servicer""),

pursuant to a Servicing Agreement (the ""Servicing Agreement""), dated as of December 5, 2019, by and among the Issuer,

the Collateral Manager, the Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Advancing Agent, the Trustee and the Note Administrator.

The

Servicing Agreement requires each of the Servicer and the Special Servicer to diligently service and administer the commercial

real estate loans (other than certain non-serviced loans) and any applicable mortgaged property acquired directly or

indirectly by the Special Servicer for the benefit of the secured parties under the Indenture. In connection with their respective

duties under the Servicing Agreement, the Servicer and the Special Servicer (or any replacement servicer or special servicer) are

entitled to monthly servicing and special servicing fees, as described in the Servicing Agreement.

The Issuer is

a Taxable Mortgage Pool

The

Issuer is a ""taxable mortgage pool"" (""TMP"") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Internal

Revenue Code""). So long as the Issuer is wholly-owned by Sub-REIT and Sub-REIT remains qualified as a real estate investment

trust (""REIT"") under the Internal Revenue Code, the Issuer is expected to be treated as a ""qualified REIT subsidiary""

that is generally treated as part of Sub-REIT rather than as a fully taxable C corporation, which is the general treatment of a

TMP that is not a wholly-owned subsidiary of a REIT.

However,

""excess inclusion income"" (""EII"") attributable to a TMP, if distributed to the stockholders of a REIT,

is taxable in all events to those stockholders regardless of the general tax characteristics of, and any tax attributes (such as

net operating losses) otherwise available to, such stockholders. For example, EII would be unrelated business taxable income if

it were distributed as dividends to stockholders of the Company that are otherwise generally exempt from U.S. federal income tax.

The Company does not intend to distribute EII to its stockholders, but to instead pay (or cause to be paid) corporate income tax

on such EII as and when it arises. Although the Company does not expect that the amount of any such corporate income tax will be

material, there are various uncertainties concerning the correct computation of EII, which are to be based on regulations that

have not yet been issued. These uncertainties could increase the amount of EII taxable to the Company or Sub-REIT above the amount

the Company anticipates, could result in a portion of the dividends distributed to stockholders being treated as EII, or both.

In

addition, if the Issuer ceased to be a ""qualified REIT subsidiary"", that would, subject to certain exceptions, generally

be an event of default under the Indenture. In order for the Issuer to remain a ""qualified REIT subsidiary"" under

the Internal Revenue Code, it must remain wholly-owned at all times by Sub-REIT or by another REIT. This generally will require

Sub-REIT to retain not only all the equity in the Issuer, but also all of those classes of Notes as to which counsel to the Company

is unable to render an opinion that they will be treated as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes if they are sold

to another party. Such restrictions on transfer will restrict the liquidity of the equity in the Issuer and of the Class E Notes

and the Class F Notes, and indirectly the assets that secure the Notes, and could prevent the Company and Sub-REIT from transferring

all or part of those positions in circumstances in which it would otherwise do so.",TRUE

Dresser-Rand Group Inc. (the ""Company"") is making

the following supplemental disclosures to the definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A (the ""Definitive Proxy Statement""),

filed by the Company with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on October 22, 2014, in

connection with the proposed settlement of Soffer v. Volpe, et al., C.A. No. 10165-CB (Del. Ch.) and Construction Industries &

Laborers Union Local 872 Pension A Trust v. Dresser-Rand Group, Inc. et al., C.A. No. 10285-CB (Del. Ch.), pending in the Delaware

Court of Chancery. Pursuant to the proposed settlement, the Company has agreed to provide the additional information set forth

below under the heading ""Supplement to Definitive Proxy Statement."" The following supplemental disclosures should be

read in conjunction with the Definitive Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. To the extent that information herein

differs from or updates information contained in the Definitive Proxy Statement, the information contained herein supersedes the

information contained in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Defined terms used but not defined herein have the meanings set forth

in the Definitive Proxy Statement.

Settlement of Certain Litigation

As previously disclosed on pages 12 and

60 of the Definitive Proxy Statement under the heading ""Litigation Relating to the Merger"" and in the Company's

Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, a putative class action lawsuit challenging the proposed

merger with Siemens Energy, Inc. (""Siemens"") was filed on September 24, 2014, on behalf of the Company's stockholders

in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The action is captioned Soffer v. Volpe et al., C.A. No. 10165-CB (Del. Ch.) (the ""Soffer

Litigation""). The complaint in the Soffer action alleges that the directors of the Company breached their fiduciary duties

to stockholders by engaging in a flawed sale process, agreeing to sell the Company for inadequate consideration and agreeing to

improper deal protection terms in the Merger Agreement. In addition, the lawsuit alleges that the Company, Siemens and Dynamo Acquisition

Corporation, the Delaware subsidiary formed by Siemens in connection with the transaction, aided and abetted these purported breaches

of fiduciary duty. The lawsuit seeks, among other things, an injunction barring the merger. On October 21, 2014, plaintiffs amended

the complaint to allege as additional basis for relief that the directors of the Company engaged in self-dealing because they will

benefit from their compensation arrangements and/or the sale of their personal stakes in the Company and that the preliminary proxy

statement filed by the Company on October 9, 2014, fails to provide stockholders with material information about the transaction

and/or is materially misleading. On October 24, 2014, Construction Industry & Laborers Union Local 872 Pension A Trust v. Dresser-Rand

Group, Inc., et al, C.A. No. 10285-CB (Del. Ch.) (the ""Union Litigation,"" and together with the Soffer Action, the

""Litigation"") was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. This complaint contains claims and allegations similar to

those in the pre-amendment Soffer complaint and seeks similar relief on behalf of the same putative class.

On November

14, 2014, the parties to the Litigation reached an agreement in principle that contemplates that the parties will enter into a

definitive stipulation of settlement. After the parties enter into the definitive stipulation of settlement, the proposed settlement

will be subject to the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery. If approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery, it is anticipated

that the settlement will result in a release of the defendants from all claims that were or could have been brought challenging

any aspect of or otherwise relating to the Merger, the merger agreement, or the disclosures made in connection therewith, and that

the Litigation will be dismissed with prejudice. Pursuant to the proposed stipulation of settlement, the Company has agreed to

make available additional information to its stockholders. There can be no assurance that the parties will ultimately enter into

a stipulation of settlement or that the Delaware Court of Chancery will approve the settlement. The settlement will not affect,

among other things, the consideration to be paid to the Company's stockholders in connection with the Merger.

The Company and the other defendants have

vigorously denied, and continue to vigorously deny, any wrongdoing and liability with respect to the facts and claims asserted,

or which could have been asserted, in the Litigation. The Company and the other defendants deny that they have committed any violations

of law or breach of fiduciary duty, that they have acted improperly in any way, or that they have any liability or owe any damages

of any kind to the plaintiffs or to the purported class, and specifically deny that any further supplemental disclosure is required

under any applicable rule, statute, regulation or law or that the Company's board of directors failed to maximize stockholder

value by entering into the merger agreement with Siemens. The settlement contemplated by the parties is not, and should not be

construed as, an admission of wrongdoing or liability by any defendant. However, among other reasons, to avoid the risk of delaying

the Merger, and to provide additional information to the Company's stockholders at a time and in a manner that would not

cause any delay of the Merger, the defendants agreed to the settlement described above. The parties considered it desirable that

the Litigation be settled to avoid the substantial burden, expense, risk, inconvenience and distraction of continued litigation

and to fully and finally resolve the Litigation.

As previously disclosed in the Definitive

Proxy Statement, a special meeting is being held on November 20, 2014, at 8:00 a.m., local time, at West8 Tower, Suite 1000, 10205

Westheimer Road, Houston, Texas 77042, for the purpose of considering and voting upon, among other things, the merger agreement.

The Company's board of directors unanimously approved the merger agreement, the Meager and the other transactions contemplated

by the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that the Company's stockholders vote ""FOR"" the proposal to

approve and adopt the merger agreement.

SUPPLEMENT TO DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT

In connection with the settlement of certain

outstanding stockholder suits as described in this Form 8-K, the Company has agreed to make these supplemental disclosures to the

The penultimate full paragraph on page

30 of the Definitive Proxy Statement is replaced, in its entirety, with the following:

On September 16, 2013, Mr. Volpe and a representative

of a potential partner (a potential strategic buyer) for a strategic transaction (""Company A"") met in Paris, France

to discuss the potential for a transaction. Subsequently, on September 19, 2013, representatives of a financial advisor for Company

A's largest stockholder (the ""Company A Stockholder"") met with representatives of DRC to express the Company

A Stockholder's interest in becoming a significant stockholder of DRC.

The last full paragraph on page 30 of

the Definitive Proxy Statement is replaced, in its entirety, with the following:

On October 4, 2013, Mr. Volpe and William

E. Macaulay, the Chairman of the DRC Board, met with a representative of Company A and of the Company A Stockholder to discuss

a potential business combination. Following this discussion, on October 10, 2013, Mr. Volpe sent a letter on behalf of the DRC

Board to representatives of the Company A Stockholder to note that, while the DRC Board did believe a strategic transaction with

Company A had the potential to be a value-creating transaction for both companies, as well as for DRC's stockholders, the

positions outlined by Company A and the Company A Stockholder during the October 4, 2013, meeting regarding relative value and

ownership were inconsistent with the views of the DRC Board on those matters, given, among other things, the DRC Board's

belief that the positions outlined by Company A and the Company A Stockholder did not represent sufficient value to DRC and DRC's

stockholders. The letter further noted that, unless Company A and the Company A Stockholder were to agree to a proposal that met

the views of the DRC Board with respect to such matters, the DRC Board did not believe further discussions regarding a strategic

transaction would be appropriate. After additional further correspondence between representatives of DRC and representatives of

Company A and the Company A Stockholder, the parties determined that, in light of their differing views regarding relative value

and ownership, they would not proceed with further discussions at such time.

The second full paragraph on page 31

of the Definitive Proxy Statement is replaced, in its entirety, with the following:

On July 17, 2014, a German business publication,

Manager Magazine, citing unidentified sources, published an article reporting that Siemens Parent had engaged a financial advisor

and had been preparing for a potential bid for DRC for several months. Prior to the publication of that article, DRC was not aware

that Siemens Parent was preparing a potential bid for DRC. DRC and Siemens Parent did not have any discussions with each other

regarding any potential transaction during this time.

The fourth full paragraph on page 31

of the Definitive Proxy Statement is replaced, in its entirety, with the following:

Following this July 18, 2014, meeting, representatives

of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (""Wachtell Lipton"") and Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP (""Gibson Dunn""),

DRC's external legal counsel, as well as representatives of Niederer Kraft & Frey AG (""Niederer Kraft""),

DRC's Swiss legal counsel, engaged in preliminary discussions with representatives of Company A, the Company A Stockholder

and their respective counsel regarding draft forms of confidentiality agreements to be executed by the parties. Representatives

of DRC also sent representatives of Company A and the Company A Stockholder a communication containing certain key principles that

DRC stated would need to be part of any transaction between DRC and Company A, including with respect to governance and management

of the post-transaction company.

The last full paragraph on page 31 of

the Definitive Proxy Statement is replaced, in its entirety, with the following:

Also on August 6, 2014, representatives

of DRC received a non-binding indicative term sheet for a potential merger-of-equals from Company A, which provided for, among

other things, a proposed pro forma ownership and headquarters of the post-transaction company, as well as the division of the Chairman

and Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and President roles among representatives of DRC and Company A, a four-week period

of exclusive negotiation between DRC and Company A and DRC's reimbursing Company A and the Company A Stockholder for all

reasonable expenses incurred by them during the exclusivity period.

The last sentence of the last paragraph

on page 31 of the Definitive Proxy Statement, which continues on page 32 thereof, is replaced, in its entirety, with the following:

In light of the renewed discussions with

Siemens Parent and Company A, the DRC Board determined that it would be advisable to approve the continuing engagement of Morgan

Stanley as financial advisor as well as the engagement of Zaoui as financial advisor because of, among other things, Morgan Stanley's

and Zaoui's complementary geographic competence and their respective financial expertise, industry knowledge and experience

in advising companies in business combination transactions.

The second full sentence of the first

paragraph on page 32 of the Definitive Proxy Statement is replaced, in its entirety, with the following:

The DRC Board and its legal counsel also

considered potential strategies to negotiate separately with both Siemens Parent and Company A to receive the highest indication

of value from both parties, including negotiating to conclusion open issues with a potential strategic transaction with each of

Siemens Parent and Company A and negotiating best and final offers from each of those companies.

The second full paragraph on page 32

of the Definitive Proxy Statement is replaced, in its entirety, with the following:

Following this meeting, on August 13, 2014,

the DRC Board held a telephonic meeting with its financial advisors and legal counsel to discuss the outcome of the August 12,

2014 meeting, the potential financial and corporate governance terms of a strategic transaction with Company A and the terms and

conditions of the potential confidentiality agreement being negotiated with representatives of Company A, including Company A's

continued request for an exclusive negotiation period. Representatives of DRC's senior management and DRC's advisors

noted that, if granted, any period of exclusive negotiation would need to be very short, and in any event not past August 31, 2014.

The DRC Board and DRC's senior management and financial and legal advisors also discussed the fact that a post-transaction

company organized under the laws of Switzerland and listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange would be subject to certain restrictions on

executive compensation that could adversely impact the retention and recruitment of executives for the post-transaction company

but that representatives of Company A suggested that there were alternative compensation arrangements that could potentially reduce

the impact of such restrictions. Following these discussions, the DRC Board requested that DRC's senior management and financial

advisors and legal counsel continue to explore and negotiate the terms of a potential transaction with Company A.

The last sentence on page 32 of the Definitive

Proxy Statement, which continues on page 33 thereof, is replaced, in its entirety, with the following:

These restrictions, however, did not prohibit

any activities with respect to third parties with whom the relevant party had any discussions regarding a business combination

in the prior two years (from DRC's perspective, this exception was specifically to permit DRC to have discussions with Siemens

Parent during the exclusivity period). Separately, Company A was notified by DRC that a meeting between Mr. Volpe and a representative

of another potential purchaser was scheduled to occur on September 1, 2014.

The fourth full paragraph on page 33

of the Definitive Proxy Statement is replaced, in its entirety, with the following:

On August 29, 2014, the DRC Board held a

telephonic meeting with representatives of DRC's senior management and its financial advisors and legal counsel to discuss

this demand from Company A, as well as to discuss generally the current status of the negotiations with Company A and the Company

A Stockholder. Following discussion, the DRC Board determined that it was premature to engage with Company A with respect to the

proposed exchange ratio in light of the outstanding open items, including with respect to governance and management of the post-transaction

company, and so directed representatives of DRC's senior management to convey to representatives of Company A that DRC was

not prepared to agree to Company A's proposed exchange ratio, but that the September 2, 2014, meeting should still take place

in order to resolve any other key issues that remained outstanding. The DRC Board scheduled a follow-up meeting on September 2,

2014, for an update on conversations with Company A, as well as an update on the outcome of Mr. Volpe's scheduled meeting

with Mr. Kaeser on September 1, 2014.

The last full paragraph on page 33 of

the Definitive Proxy Statement is replaced, in its entirety, with the following:

On September 1, 2014, Mr. Volpe met with

Mr. Kaeser in Paris to discuss further their earlier telephone conversation. During their meeting, Mr. Kaeser indicated Siemens

Parent's interest in an all cash acquisition of DRC, but did not propose a specific valuation for such transaction. While

Mr. Kaeser also expressed Siemens Parent's interest in potentially retaining certain members of DRC's senior management

following consummation of the potential transaction, Messrs. Kaeser and Volpe agreed that any discussions regarding retention of

specific employees or the terms of any such continued employment would only occur after the execution and announcement of definitive

agreements with respect to the potential transaction.

The third full sentence on page 34 of

the Definitive Proxy Statement is replaced, in its entirety, with the following:

The DRC Board also discussed the current

status of negotiations with Company A and the Company A Stockholder and determined that an exchange ratio that would result in

DRC's stockholders owning 50% of the post-transaction company did not represent sufficient value to DRC and DRC's stockholders

relative to the value of DRC as a standalone company. The DRC Board further considered at what exchange ratio a proposed strategic

transaction with Company A would represent sufficient value to DRC and its stockholders. On August 29, 2014, the DRC Board held

a telephonic meeting with representatives of DRC's senior management and its financial advisors and legal counsel to discuss

this demand from Company A, as well as to discuss generally the current status of the negotiations with Company A and the Company

A Stockholder.

The third full paragraph on page 34 of

the Definitive Proxy Statement is replaced, in its entirety, with the following:

On September 7, 2014, representatives of

DRC's senior management and Company A's senior management and board of directors agreed to defer the discussion of

the exchange ratio in order to attempt to negotiate and resolve the other outstanding issues remaining in the proposed transaction

agreements, including, among other things, the structure of the proposed transaction, governance and management issues (such as

the governance rights of and restrictions on the Company A Stockholder with respect to the post-transaction company and the composition

and role of the board, board committees and management of the post-transaction company), deal protection provisions and the name

of the post-transaction company. Between September 8 and 12, 2014, financial advisors and legal counsel for DRC, Company A and

the Company A Stockholder resumed negotiation of the terms of the transaction agreements for the proposed strategic transaction

between DRC and Company A and between DRC and the Company A Stockholder.

The last paragraph on page 34 of the

Definitive Proxy Statement, which continues on page 35 thereof, is replaced, in its entirety, with the following:

Later that day, the DRC Board held a telephonic

meeting with representatives of DRC's senior management and its financial advisor and legal counsel, at which meeting Mr.

Volpe informed the DRC Board of his conversation with Mr. Kaeser. Representatives of DRC's senior management also updated

the board on the ongoing negotiations with Company A and the Company A Stockholder. After discussion with its financial advisors

and legal counsel, the DRC Board instructed Mr. Volpe to communicate to Mr. Kaeser that Siemens Parent's proposed per-share

acquisition price would need to be in the $80s to represent sufficient value to the DRC stockholders, and that DRC would need strong

commitments from Siemens Parent relating to transaction certainty. The DRC Board, considering the timing expectations of Company

A and the Company A Stockholder with respect to the proposed transaction, the various reports in the press regarding a potential

transaction involving DRC and the DRC Board's desire to conclude negotiations with Siemens Parent and Company A to minimize

continued distraction of DRC's management and diversion of other DRC's resources, also instructed Mr. Volpe to communicate

to Mr. Kaeser that DRC would need to receive a firm and highest-value proposal from Siemens Parent as quickly as possible (and

prior to the DRC Board meeting scheduled for September 16, 2014, if practicable). Following this meeting, Mr. Volpe spoke with

Mr. Kaeser to communicate the message from the DRC Board, including emphasizing the need for a firm and highest-value proposal

prior to the September 16, 2014, board meeting. Following the call, Mr. Volpe sent a confidentiality agreement to Mr. Kaeser to

permit Siemens Parent's review of certain confidential information regarding DRC, which agreement contained certain standstill

restrictions prohibiting Siemens Parent from acquiring additional shares of DRC common stock or engaging in certain strategic transactions

involving DRC (other than the contemplated transaction with Siemens Parent), subject to exceptions in the event a third-party transaction

were to be approved by the DRC Board. On September 13, 2014, the parties executed the confidentiality agreement, and Siemens Parent

commenced its due diligence review of DRC's confidential information.

The last full paragraph on page 35 of

the Definitive Proxy Statement is replaced, in its entirety, with the following:

Later that day, the DRC Board held a telephonic

meeting with representatives of DRC's senior management and its financial advisors and legal counsel, during which representatives

of DRC's senior management updated the DRC Board on the Siemens Parent offer letter and the ongoing negotiations with representatives

of Company A. After discussion with its financial and legal advisors, the DRC Board, considering the timing expectations of Company

A and the Company A Stockholder with respect to the proposed transaction, the various reports in the press regarding a potential

transaction involving DRC and the DRC Board's desire to conclude negotiations with Siemens Parent and Company A to minimize

continued distraction of DRC's management and diversion of other DRC's resources, instructed representatives of DRC's

senior management and its financial advisors and legal counsel to continue negotiating the terms of a potential transaction with

Siemens Parent and the terms of a potential transaction with Company A, with the goal of receiving the highest indication of value

from both parties. The DRC Board also scheduled a follow-up meeting for the morning of September 21, 2014, with the goal of reviewing

both parties' best and final indications of value.

The following disclosure supplements

the disclosure on page 35 of the Definitive Proxy Statement by adding a new sentence immediately after the last sentence of the

second full paragraph on page 35 of the Definitive Proxy Statement:

The firm offer did not include any agreements,

arrangements or commitments with respect to the employment of Mr. Volpe or any other member of DRC's senior management following

consummation of the potential transaction. The parties agreed that any discussions, if any, regarding any such agreements, arrangements

or commitments would only occur after the execution and announcement of definitive agreements with respect to the potential transaction.

The last paragraph on page 35 of the

Definitive Proxy Statement, which continues on page 36 thereof, is replaced, in its entirety, with the following:

Pursuant to these instructions, between

September 16 and 21, 2014, representatives of DRC's, Company A's and the Company A Stockholder's respective senior

management, financial advisors and legal counsel continued to negotiate the terms of transaction agreements for a potential strategic

transaction with Company A. During these discussions, the DRC representatives stressed the fact that Company A would need to present

its highest indication of value for the transaction as soon as possible, and representatives of Company A's senior management

indicated that the highest exchange ratio Company A was prepared to offer was an exchange ratio that would result in DRC's

current stockholders owning 51.5% of the post-transaction company. Similarly, during this period representatives of DRC's

and Siemens Parent's respective senior management, financial advisors and legal counsel continued to negotiate the terms

of transaction agreements for a potential acquisition of DRC by Siemens Parent DRC's senior management and financial and

legal advisors also considered the means by which DRC's stockholders could be compensated if the time period to the closing

of a potential acquisition of DRC by Siemens Parent was extended due to the regulatory approval process. In that regard, representatives

of DRC's senior management requested that Siemens Parent agree to pay a monthly ""ticking fee"" if a transaction

between DRC and Siemens Parent were not completed expeditiously after executing definitive documents for such transaction. DRC's

and Siemens Parent's respective senior management and financial and legal advisors then began negotiating the amount of such

fee and the period during which it would apply. Subsequently, representatives of Siemens Parent's senior management agreed

that Siemens Parent would pay a ""ticking fee"" of $0.55 per share per month (in addition to the $83 per share of ""base""

merger consideration originally offered), with such monthly fee to accrue from the fifth month after execution of definitive documents

to the month in which the transaction is consummated.

The following disclosure supplements

the disclosure on page 36 of the Definitive Proxy Statement by adding the following new sentences immediately following the first

sentence of the last full paragraph on page 36 of the Definitive Proxy Statement:

DRC's senior management and financial

advisors believed that this proposal represented an implicit value of approximately $80.90 per share of DRC common stock. The September

20 proposal did not include any other revised terms.

The following disclosure supplements

the disclosure on page 36 of the Definitive Proxy Statement by adding a new sentence immediately before the last sentence on page

36 of the Definitive Proxy Statement:

The DRC Board also considered that no third

party was likely to emerge with a proposal that represented superior value to DRC's stockholders relative to Siemens Parent's

all-cash offer, given, among other things, the various reports in the press regarding a potential transaction involving DRC and

no third party had provided DRC with a proposed transaction that provided superior value to the proposed transaction with Siemens,

and the significant value offered by the transaction with Siemens Parent.

Effective

December 1, 2007, RemoteMDx, Inc., a Utah corporation (the "" Company ""), entered

into and closed a Stock Purchase Agreement (the ""Purchase Agreement"") with the

shareholders of Midwest Monitoring & Surveillance, Inc., a Minnesota

corporation with principal offices in Fairmont, MN ("" MM&S "").  MM&S

is engaged in providing parole and probation monitoring equipment and

services.  MM&S, a customer of the Company, is owned by Gary

Bengtson, Gary Shelton, Larry Sanders and Sue Sanders (the "" Sellers "").

Pursuant

to the Purchase Agreement, the Company will acquire 51% of the issued and

outstanding capital stock of MM&S, together with the option (the "" Buyer's Option ""),

exercisable at the discretion of the Company after January 1, 2009, and prior

to

March 31, 2009, to acquire the remaining 49% of MM&S capital

stock.  The consideration for the initial purchase of 51% of the

outstanding MM&S shares, which will give control of MM&S to the Company,

is $3.4 million, payable in cash, and 438,000 shares of the common stock

of the

Company (the "" RMDX

Shares ""). Closing is expected to occur on or before December 31, 2007,

but may be extended by the parties under certain conditions through January

20,

2008.  The RMDX Shares to be issued as part of the consideration for

the MM&S shares will be placed in escrow, and will be released, subject to

adjustment under the terms of the Purchase Agreement following completion

of an

audit of the MM&S financial statements for the year ending December 31,

2007.

The

Buyer's Option is exercisable at the Company's sole discretion.  The

Company also granted an option to the Sellers (the "" Sellers' Put Option "")

to require the Company to purchase the remaining MM&S shares if the Company

fails or elects not to exercise the Buyer's Option.  The option

exercise price, if either the Buyer's Option or the Sellers' Put Option granted

under the Purchase Agreement is exercised, will be based on a multiple of

the

net revenues of MM&S for the 12 months ending December 31,

2008.  The Purchase Agreement provides that if the Sellers exercise

the Sellers' Put Option and the Company fails or refuses to purchase the

remaining outstanding common stock of MM&S, the Sellers may require the

Company to surrender and reconvey to Sellers part or all of the MM&S shares

it obtained initially under the Purchase Agreement.

Under

the

Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right to appoint a majority of the

board

of directors of MM&S.  The Purchase Agreement also contains

affirmative covenants obligating the Sellers with respect to the post-closing

operations of MM&S that are common in such agreements, as well as various

representations and warranties of the Company, the Sellers and

MM&S.  Each representation and warranty was made in connection

with the Company's negotiations with the Sellers and MM&S, and is subject to

specifically disclosed exceptions, qualifications, and limitations agreed

by the

parties in connection with the negotiations.  In addition, certain

representations and warranties were made as of a specific date, may be subject

to a contractual standard of materiality different from what a shareholder

might

view as material, or may have been made for purposes of allocating contractual

risk among the parties, rather than establishing matters as

facts.  Accordingly, investors should not view the representations and

warranties contained in the Purchase Agreement as disclosures with respect

to

the actual state of facts concerning the business, operations or condition

such.  Investors should read the Purchase Agreement together with the

Establishment of Special Committee of the Board of Directors

On October 24, 2017, the board of directors

(the "" Board "") of First Capital Investment Corporation (the "" Company "") approved the establishment

of a special committee of the Board (the "" Special Committee "") to evaluate and arrange for the disposition of

the Company's investments in First Capital Retail, LLC ("" FCR "") and to review the Company's investment

portfolio. The Board appointed Dr. Bob Froehlich, Frank Grant and Jeff Davi, each of whom is an independent director, as members

of the Special Committee and appointed Dr. Froehlich as chair of the Special Committee. The Special Committee is authorized to

select and retain, at its discretion, legal, financial, investment banking and other advisors or consultants as it deems necessary

to represent the Company in bankruptcy proceedings of FCR and to arrange for the disposition of the Company's investments

in FCR. The Special Committee has full authority to approve the disposition of the Company's investments in FCR following

its evaluation and review of potential transactions.

Update Regarding FCR

As previously reported,

on September 15, 2017, FCR filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United

States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of California. The Company was not initially listed as a creditor on the bankruptcy

filing and had no advance notice of the filing. At the time, based on its familiarity with FCR's operations, the Company

did not believe that FCR's bankruptcy filing would materially impede the Company's efforts to dispose of its investments

in FCR or the terms or value of such a sale transaction to an unaffiliated third party.

On October 12, 2017,

FCR amended its bankruptcy filing to, among other things, name the Company as a creditor and include a full accounting of its

assets and liabilities. Upon review of the amended bankruptcy filing, and following discussions with bankruptcy counsel, the Company

believes that the fair value of its investments in FCR have been materially impaired as a result of the bankruptcy filing. In addition,

the bankruptcy filing has complicated efforts to sell the Company's investments to an unaffiliated third party within a reasonable

timeframe.

Change in Address

The Company has changed its principal business

address to 410 Park Avenue, 14 th  Floor, New York, NY 10022. Its new phone number is (646) 512-9054.

Execution of Definitive Agreement with Longdan

As previously reported, the Company has been negotiating a definitive agreement with Hubei Longdan Biological Medicine Technology Co. Ltd. (Longdan), a company organized under the laws of the Peoples Republic of China (the PRC), pursuant to which the Company would issue approximately eighty nine percent (89%) of its capital stock to Longdans shareholders in return for acquisition of the business of Longdan (the Acquisition).  Longdan is engaged in the production and sale of pharmaceutical products in the PRC.

On March 14, 2007, the Company, Hubei Longdan (Delaware), Inc., a Delaware corporation that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (Longdan Delaware), Longdan and Longdan International Inc., a corporation formed under the laws of Nevis (Longdan International), entered into an Acquisition Agreement (the Agreement).

Under the terms of the Agreement, it is contemplated that the Company will convert from a Delaware limited partnership to a newly-formed Delaware corporation to be called Longdan International Holding, Inc. (LIH) and Longdan International will merge with and into Longdan Delaware.  At the Merger Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement), the shareholders of Longdan will be issued shares representing approximately eighty nine percent (89%) of the capital stock of the Company and the Companys shareholders will hold shares representing approximately eleven percent (11%) of the capital stock of the Company, in each case, on an as if converted basis.

The Acquisition has been structured to comply with certain limitations on the foreign ownership of Chinese companies under the laws of the PRC.  In anticipation of the possible Acquisition, on December 20, 2006, Longdan entered into certain agreements with Longdan International.  Pursuant to these agreements, Longdan International provides exclusive technology consulting and other general business operations services to Longdan in return for payment of consulting fees that are equal to Longdans net profits.  Longdans shareholders have pledged their equity interests in Longdan to Longdan International to secure the contract obligations and have granted Longdan International an irrevocable proxy to vote their interests and an exclusive option to purchase these interests, which arrangements are enforceable to the fullest extent permitted under the laws of the PRC.

Longdan has advised the Company that it believes that this structure qualifies Longdan International as a variable interest entity that is permitted to consolidate its financial statements with Longdan, the operating entity with which it has qualifying contractual arrangements.

Under the terms of the Agreement, LIH will have three series of Common Stock (Series Class A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock and Series C Common Stock).   The limited partnership interests of the partners of the Company will convert into approximately Three Hundred Eighty Five Thousand (385,000) shares of Series B Common Stock, and individual limited partners will receive shares of Series B Common Stock based on a conversion formula whereby one (1) share of Series B Common Stock of LIH will be issued for each eight and one tenth (8.1) limited partnership unit of the Company, rounded upwards to the nearest whole share of Series B Common Stock, subject to adjustment in the event of a change in the total number of limited partnership interests at the Conversion Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement).

At the Merger Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement), the issued and outstanding capital stock of LIH will be 16,126,824 shares comprised as follows:

*

175,000 shares of Series A Common Stock

*

1,922,016 shares of Series B Common Stock

*

14,029,808 shares of Series C Common Stock

The terms of the Series are as follows:

*

the Series A Common Stock will have ten (10) votes for each share and shall be convertible into shares of Series B Common Stock on a one for one basis at any time at the election of the holder

*

the Series B Common Stock will have one (1) vote for each share

*

the Series C Common Stock will have one tenth (0.1) vote for each share and shall be convertible into shares of Series B Common Stock on the basis of ten (10) shares of Series C Common Stock for each one (1) share of Series B Common Stock; in addition, each share of Series C Common Stock will receive dividends and distributions, as well as in the event of liquidation, on an as if converted basis.

The shares of each series of Common Stock will vote together as one group and shall be entitled to an equal portion of any dividend or distribution and shall be equal in priority as to payment of any dividends or other distributions by LIH, as well as in the event of liquidation.

Longdan has agreed to pay all costs associated with the Acquisition, including legal fees incurred in connection with the related corporate law transactions and required filings under the securities laws, and has also agreed to pay for any costs incurred by the Company in connection with maintaining its registration under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, from the time of the final distribution to its partners until the earlier of consummation of a Acquisition or termination of the Agreement.

The approval of the Companys partners is a condition to the consummation of the Acquisition.

The Company is currently preparing preliminary proxy materials to be filed with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) in connection with a meeting of partners to vote on the Acquisition.  The meeting will be held twenty (20) days after mailing of the definitive proxy materials to the Companys partners.  The Company currently anticipates that the meeting will be held in the third week of April, 2007.

Federated National Insurance Company (""Federated  National""),  a wholly

owned  subsidiary of 21st Century  Holding Company (the  ""Company""),  has, as of

June 28, 2005, agreed upon its aggregate  catastrophe  reinsurance  coverage for

the 2005-2006 hurricane season.

Federated National's  reinsurance  arrangements are with reinsurers in the

U.S., London and Bermuda  reinsurance  markets, as well as the Florida Hurricane

Catastrophe Fund, as follows:

Platinum Underwriters Reinsurance, Inc.

Alea North America Insurance Company

American Re-Insurance Company

DaVinci Reinsurance Ltd.

Renaissance Reinsurance Ltd.

Rosemont Reinsurance Ltd.

PXRE Reinsurance Ltd.

Ace Tempest Reinsurance  Ltd.

Amlin Underwriting Limited

Cathedral Underwriting Limited

Axa Re

This  reinsurance   coverage  will  reimburse  Federated  National  for

property losses under its homeowners'  insurance  policies resulting from storms

that cause damage in the State of Florida, the state in which Federated National

is currently writing these types of policies,  through June 30, 2006. Under this

coverage, Federated National is responsible for the first $3 million in property

losses  resulting  from  a  storm  and  Federated   National's   reinsurers  are

responsible  for the next $212  million in  aggregate  property  losses for said

storm.  Our amount of  reinsurance  coverage was  determined by  subjecting  our

property risks to statistical forecasting models that are designed to quantify a

catastrophic  event in terms of the frequency of a storm occurring once in every

""n"" years. Our reinsurance coverage  contemplates a catastrophic event occurring

once  every  100  years.   Federated   National  has  also  obtained   automatic

reinstatement   coverage,   meaning  that  the  reinsurance   coverage  will  be

automatically available for a second storm with the same $3 million retention by

Federated National.

As  compared  to  Federated  National's  reinsurance  coverage  for the

2004-2005  hurricane  season,  the current  season's  coverage  would reduce the

losses retained by Federated National. For example, whereas Federated National's

net  retained  losses  in 2004  from  Hurricanes  Charley  and  Frances  totaled

approximately $20 million,  if the current year's coverage had been in effect in

2004, Federated National's net retained losses would have totaled  approximately

$6 million.

Federated  National's  premiums  for the  reinsurance  coverage are $19

million payable in quarterly installments beginning July 1, 2005 for the private

reinsurers  and a total  of $7  million  payable  in three  installments  to the

Florida  Hurricane  Catastrophe Fund from August 2005 through December 2005. The

greater  expense  resulting  from  these  premiums  has  been  reflected  in the

Company's previously announced earnings guidance for 2005.

of Reorganization (the ""Merger Agreement"") by and among Sino, Wins Finance Holdings Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted

company and wholly owned subsidiary of Sino (""Holdco""), Wins Finance Group Ltd., a British Virgin Islands international

business company (""Wins""), and each of Wits Global Limited, Appelo Limited, Glowing Assets Holdings Limited and Cosmic

Expert Limited, each of which are British Virgin Islands international companies and shareholders of Wins that, collectively,

own 100% of Wins's outstanding capital and voting shares (""Wins Shareholders""). Upon the consummation of the

transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (i) Sino shall merge with and into Holdco, with Holdco surviving the merger

(the ""Merger""), whereupon all the issued and outstanding securities of Sino shall be automatically converted into

securities of Holdco as provided in the applicable provisions of the Merger Agreement and (ii) immediately following the Merger,

an exchange of 100% of the ordinary shares of Wins by the Wins Shareholders for cash and ordinary shares of Holdco (the ""Share

Exchange"" together with the Merger, the ""Transactions"").

Wins

is an integrated financing solution provider with operations located primarily in Jinzhong City, Shanxi Province and Beijing,

China. Wins' goal is to assist Chinese small & medium enterprises, including microenterprises, which have limited access

to financing, in improving their overall fund-raising capability and enable them to obtain funding for business development.

The

transaction is expected to be consummated in the third quarter of 2015, after the required approval by the stockholders of

Sino and the fulfillment of certain other conditions, as described herein and in the Merger Agreement.

The

following summaries of the Transactions and related transactions, the Merger Agreement and the other agreements to be entered

into by the parties are qualified in their entirety by reference to the text of the agreements, certain of which are attached

as exhibits hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.

Effect

of the Merger

Upon

consummation of the Merger:

* each

share of Sino common stock will be exchanged for one ordinary share of Holdco (""Holdco

Shares""), except that holders of shares of Sino's common stock sold in its

initial public offering (""public shares"") shall be entitled to elect instead

to receive a pro rata portion of Sino's trust account, as provided in Sino's

charter documents;

* each

Sino right will be exchanged for one-tenth of a Holdco Share; and

Consideration

in the Share Exchange

Upon

consummation of the Share Exchange, the Wins Shareholders, in exchange for all of the capital stock of Wins outstanding immediately

prior to the Share Exchange, will receive from Holdco:

* an

amount of cash (""Cash Consideration"") equal to (a) the cash remaining in

Sino's trust fund after giving effect to the payments required to the shareholders

of Sino who elect to have their shares converted to cash in accordance with the provisions

of Sino's charter documents less (b) $5,000,000;  provided, however , that

the Cash Consideration shall not exceed $25,000,000 in the aggregate; and

* a

number of Holdco Shares to be issued in the names directed by each Wins Shareholder determined

by dividing (1) $168,000,000 less the Cash Consideration, including any foregone Cash

Consideration as discussed below, by (2) $10.00.

4

Notwithstanding

the foregoing, the Wins Shareholders shall have the option to forego receiving any Cash Consideration and instead receive such

consideration in additional Holdco Shares at $10.00 per share. If the Wins Shareholders were to forego receiving all of the cash

consideration, they would receive up to an additional 2,500,000 Holdco Shares.

Lock-Up

Agreements

The

Wins Shareholders have agreed not to transfer the Holdco Shares they will receive as a result of the Share Exchange from the closing

of the transaction (""Closing Date"") until the day preceding the day that is twelve months after the Closing Date (subject

to limited exceptions). These restrictions will end earlier than such date with respect to 50% of the shares if the closing price

of the Holdco Shares exceeds $13.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period following the Closing Date.

Registration

Rights

The

Wins Shareholders will enter into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement with Holdco substantially in the form

of the existing registration rights agreement, dated as of August 26, 2014, among Sino and Sino's stockholders prior to

the consummation of its initial public offering (the ""Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement""). Pursuant

to the Amended and Restated Registration Statement, the Wins Shareholders shall be entitled to demand that Holdco register the

resale of the Holdco Shares they receive in the Share Exchange. In addition, the holders will have certain ""piggy-back""

registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the Transactions. Holdco will bear the expenses

incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.

Indemnification

of Holdco

To

provide a fund for payment to Holdco with respect to its post-closing rights to indemnification under the Merger Agreement for

breaches of representations and warranties and covenants by Wins and its subsidiaries and the Wins Shareholders, there will be

placed in escrow (with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as escrow agent) an aggregate of 10% of the Holdco Shares

to be received in the Stock Exchange. The escrow will be the sole remedy for Holdco for its rights to indemnification under the

Merger Agreement. Subject to certain exceptions, claims for indemnification may be asserted against the escrow fund by Holdco

once its damages exceed a $2,000,000 deductible (the ""Deductible""), in which event the entire amount of such claim(s)

shall be payable from the first dollar. The shares held in escrow will be released on the earlier of (a) the 30 th  day

after the date Holdco has filed with the SEC its Annual Report for the year ending December 31, 2016 and (b) March 31, 2017, subject

to reduction based on shares cancelled for claims ultimately resolved and those still pending resolution.

Representations

and Warranties

The

Inland

Real Estate Corporation (the Company) has formed a new joint venture, INP

Retail, L.P. (the Partnership), with PGGM Private Real Estate Fund, a leading

Dutch pension fund administrator and asset manager (PGGM).  The Partnership will be governed by a limited

partnership agreement dated June 3, 2010 (the Agreement) between the

Company and an affiliate of PGGM (referred to herein as PGGM PRE Fund), as

limited partners and INP Retail Management Company, LLC, a Delaware limited

liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the General

Partner), as the general partner.  Subject

to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, the parties anticipate that the

Partnership will acquire up to approximately $278 million of neighborhood and

community retail centers located in the Companys targeted markets throughout

the Midwest, including up to 16 identified properties currently owned by the

Company.  In addition to other

requirements, the acquisition of properties by the Partnership is subject to

the approval of the limited partners.

The

Company will hold a 55% equity ownership interest and PGGM PRE Fund will hold a

45% equity ownership interest in the Partnership.  The General Partner will have general

authority for the day-to-day management and operations of the Partnership.  Certain decisions, identified in the

Agreement as major decisions require the consent of both limited

partners.  The General Partner or other

affiliates of the Company as agreed to by the limited partners will earn fees

for performing the ventures acquisition, property management and leasing

functions and other services provided to the venture.

Initially,

the Company has agreed to contribute three retail centers with an approximate

net equity value of $45 million.  As of

the closing of the Companys contribution of the three retail centers, PGGM

will contribute approximately $20 million of equity capital.

The

Agreement provides that, after the initial investment, the Company and the

General Partner will identify retail centers meeting specific investment

guidelines for acquisition by the Partnership.

If the limited partners agree to the acquisition of a target property,

the limited partners will contribute additional capital to the Partnership to

cover acquisition expenses.  The Companys

additional capital contribution to the Partnership will be in the form of

either a portion of the cash balance remaining from PGGM PRE Funds prior cash

contribution, or an additional property.

PGGM PRE Fund will contribute additional equity to the venture as new properties

are approved for acquisition to cover its portion of acquisition expenses.

Under

the terms of the Agreement, Inlands total contributions to the Partnership

will not exceed approximately $160 million.

PGGM PRE Funds total equity contribution will not exceed $130 million.

With

respect to financing, the Partnership will target an overall

loan-to-total-value ratio of 30% with a maximum of 40% during the first year of

the existence of the Partnership, and an overall loan-to-value of 40% with a

maximum of 50% for the remaining life of the Partnership.

Each

property will be held by a single member limited liability company (each, a Property

Entity).  The sole member of each

Property Entity will be one of two limited liability companies qualified as a

real estate investment trust (each, a REIT Entity).  The Partnership will own no

2

less

than 99% of the equity ownership in each REIT Entity.  The remaining equity ownership will be held

by that number of persons necessary for such entities to qualify as real estate

investment trusts.

The

Agreement provides for a maximum term of ten years, subject to extension by the

agreement of the limited partners.  The

Partnership may be terminated at an earlier date upon certain specified events,

including the sale of all owned properties.

Beginning

in the sixth year of the Partnership, PGGM PRE Fund has a put option, and the

Company has a purchase option, in either event to cause the Company to buy PGGM

PRE-Funds interest in the Partnership.

Such options allow for the purchase of up to 20% of PGGM PRE-Funds

interest in the Partnership per year for a purchase price determined through an

appraisal process.  The purchase price is

payable in cash or in shares of stock of the Company.  The parties may accelerate the exercise of

the options upon the dissolution of the Partnership, to the full extent of PGGM

PRE-Funds interest in the Partnership.

Integrated Healthcare

Holdings, Inc. (the "" Company "") previously disclosed it was the subject of a lawsuit filed in June 2008 by Michael

W. Fitzgibbons, M.D., entitled "" Michael W.   Fitzgibbons, M.D. vs. Integrated Healthcare Holdings, Inc. "",

Superior Court of the State of California, County of Orange (the "" Court ""), Case No. 30-2008-00108081.

At trial, three of

Dr. Fitzgibbons' four original causes of action-- i.e. , those alleging malicious prosecution, interference with

prospective economic advantage and defamation--were dismissed by the Court before the case was submitted to the jury. The

jury returned a verdict in Dr. Fitzgibbons' favor on the sole remaining cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional

distress. The jury's verdict awarded Dr. Fitzgibbons $5.2 million in consequential damages and $500,000 in punitive damages.

The Company therefore reserved $5.2 million as a contingent loss in its financial statements as of December 31, 2012, as reflected

in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2012.

After the Court entered

a $5.7 million judgment against the Company based on the jury's verdict, in March 2013 the Company timely filed a motion

for judgment notwithstanding the verdict ("" JNOV "") and concurrent motion for a new trial. On April 30, 2013,

the Court granted the Company's JNOV motion and provisionally granted the Company's motion for a new trial. Copies

of the Court orders are filed as exhibits to this Form 8-K.

Among other things,

the Court found:

* The jury's verdict was not supported by substantial evidence.

* The jury's damage award was excessive and ""completely out of line with .... other

cases"". According to the Court, ""[t]here were no physical manifestations of injury [to Dr. Fitzgibbons]. While [Dr.

Fitzgibbons] sustained embarrassment, the emotional distress was not of a substantial quality or duration. At worst, some other

doctors poked fun at him.""

* ""[I]t is more probable than not"" the jury engaged in misconduct prejudicial to the

Company.

As a result of the

Court's April 30, 2013 order:

1. The jury's $5.7 verdict for Dr. Fitzgibbons was set aside in its entirety and the Court's

$5.7 million judgment against the Company based on the jury's verdict was vacated in its entirety.

2. As of April 30, 2013, a new and amended judgment in favor of the Company and against Dr. Fitzgibbons

was entered by the Court.

3. The new and amended judgment specifies that Dr. Fitzgibbons shall take nothing from the Company

and the Company may recover from Dr. Fitzgibbons the Company's cost of the litigation.

4. If for any reason the Company's JNOV motion is reversed on appeal, the Court provisionally

granted the Company's request for a new trial on multiple grounds.

Due to these favorable

rulings, the Company reversed the $5.2 million contingent loss that was reserved on its financial statements as of December 31,

2012. The reversal will be reflected in the Company's financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2013.",FALSE

sold 1,079 shares of the newly created Series B Convertible Adjustable Preferred

Stock (""Series B Preferred Stock"") for an aggregate purchase price of $1,079,000

to accredited investors (the ""Purchasers"").

In

connection with the sale of the Series B Preferred Stock, Wherify granted the

Purchasers five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate 1,685,938 shares of

common stock with an exercise price equal to 130% of the greater of (i) $0.16

per share or (ii) 80% of the trailing 10-day per share volume-weighted average

price of Wherify's common stock (which amount shall in no event be more than

$0.20). Also, in connection with the sale, Wherify granted the placement agent

a

five-year warrant to purchase 674,375 shares of common stock at an exercise

price equal to the Purchasers' warrants.

Taking

into account the placement agent commission of $140,270 and other placement

expenses, Wherify received net cash proceeds of approximately $813,000. Wherify

will use the proceeds for general working capital purposes.

The

Series B Preferred Stock issued as a result of this sale possesses both an

optional and mandatory conversion feature which converts Preferred Stock into

a

number of shares of common stock (""Conversion Shares""). The initial conversion

rate is equal to the per share stated value of the Series B Preferred Stock,

initially $1,000, divided by $0.16. The conversion price of the Series B

Preferred Stock is subject to adjustment in routine circumstances.

The

holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative

quarterly dividends at the rate of ten percent (10%) (the ""Series B Dividend"")

of the stated value of the Series B Preferred Stock payable in cash or in Series

B Preferred Stock on each outstanding share of the Series B Preferred Stock.

of the warrants issued to the placement agent and (Z) all shares of common

stock

issuable upon conversion of any shares of Series B Preferred stock issued as

dividend payments (the ""Share Increase""), the terms of the Series B Preferred

Stock will be adjusted as follows (the ""Adjustment""):

stated value of each share of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding will be

increased by 150%; and

foregoing; and

*                    Board committees to be composed of members

determined in accordance with the Governance Agreement and subject to certain independence

requirements set forth therein.

As discussed below in Item 5.02, the Companys current President and

Chief Executive Officer, Patricia M. Newman, is to resign from her positions

with the Company on May 1, 2007, or as soon thereafter as possible.  Pursuant to the terms of the Governance

Agreement, immediately upon Ms. Newmans resignation, the Company and DelStaff

will cause Mr. Willis to be appointed as the Companys Chief Executive

Officer.  The terms of any employment or

similar arrangement with Mr. Willis as the Companys Chief Executive Officer

will be determined by a majority of the

2

Companys independent directors upon recommendation of the Companys

Compensation Committee.

Pursuant to the terms of the Governance Agreement, immediately after

the Companys special meeting of stockholders scheduled to be held on June 29,

2007, Mr. Stover will provide the Company with his resignation as Chairman of

the Board, as a director and as an employee of the Company, and Mr. Stover and

the Company will execute and deliver a mutual release of claims.  Immediately after Mr. Stovers resignation,

if Mr. Willis is then serving as the Companys Chief Executive Officer, the

Board (other than Mr. Willis) will make a determination regarding appointing

Mr. Willis as Chairman of the Board, and if so appointed Mr. Willis will serve

in such capacity until his successor is elected and qualified or until his

earlier death, resignation or removal.

DelStaff has agreed that the representation event, as it applies to

and was defined in connection with DelStaffs purchase of Company common stock

from the Stockholders as described above, will be deemed to occur at the

earlier of (i) immediately after the Companys special meeting of stockholders,

which is scheduled to be held on June 29, 2007, and (ii) the close of business

on June 29, 2007.

With respect to the performance of the Companys obligations under the

Governance Agreement, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Board

composition and related requirements thereof, the Board is entitled to act in

accordance with its fiduciary obligations to the Company and its stockholders

under applicable law and is entitled to take such actions as are necessary to

comply with applicable law; provided, however that the Board has determined

that as of the date of the Governance Agreement, the transactions contemplated

thereby are in the best interests of the Companys stockholders.

Pursuant to the terms of the Governance Agreement, all directors who

are not employees of the Company are to be paid, subject to future increases

upon recommendation by the Compensation Committee, at least a $25,000 retainer

per year and an additional $6,000 annual fee for committee chairmanship, plus

an additional fee of $1,000 per Board or committee meeting attended in person

or $500 for each telephonic Board or committee meeting attended.  Non-employee directors are also to be

reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in performing their duties as

directors.  The Company has also agreed to

add the directors nominated by DelStaff to the Companys existing directors

and officers liability insurance policy and enter into indemnification

agreements with them.

DelStaff and Mr. Willis agreed in the Governance Agreement to use their

reasonable best efforts to ensure that each of the directors nominated by

DelStaff will, after receipt of any offer or inquiry to purchase all or

substantially all of the Companys common stock held by DelStaff, disclose such

offer or inquiry to the remaining members of the Board no later than five

business days prior to the execution of a definitive agreement prior to such

sale; provided that the Company agrees to take no action to frustrate the sale

process unless the Board reasonably determines that such action is required in

order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under

Delaware law or to preserve the rights of the Company under the Governance

Agreement.  DelStaff and Mr. Willis

further agreed that, until sixty (60) days after the date of the Governance

Agreement, they and their affiliates (as defined in the Governance Agreement)

will not acquire beneficial ownership

3

of

any additional shares of the Companys common stock; however, if the Company

issues shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for

common stock during such 60-day period (other than pursuant to existing equity

incentive plans), then it will extend to DelStaff the right to purchase its pro

rata share of such securities.

Following the restructuring of the Board as described above, the

Company and DelStaff have agreed to take or cause to be taken all necessary

actions, including calling the Companys special meeting of stockholders scheduled

to be held on June 29, 2007, to amend the Companys certificate of

incorporation to permit any stockholder that beneficially owns twenty percent

(20%) or more of the total voting power of the Companys outstanding voting

securities to call a special meeting of stockholders.  The Company and DelStaff currently intend to

submit such proposed amendment for stockholder approval at the Companys

special meeting of stockholders scheduled to be held on June 29, 2007.

The Governance Agreement will terminate if and when DelStaff, Mr.

Willis and their respective affiliates collectively cease to beneficially own

securities representing at least 20% of the outstanding voting securities of

the Company and have filed a Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G with the SEC reporting

such change.  The Governance Agreement

On August 21, 2019, Spire STL Pipeline LLC (""Spire STL Pipeline"") filed an amended application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (""FERC""), requesting approval of revised recourse rates as a result of an increase in its estimated overall construction costs.

Due to historic flooding of major rivers along the pipeline route, completion of construction has been delayed.  In Spire Inc.'s (""Spire"") fiscal 2019 third quarter earnings communications on July 30, 2019, Spire stated the delay would cause construction costs to exceed $240 million, the top end of the range of estimated costs, and that the expected in-service date would shift to later in calendar 2019.

As part of its FERC filing, Spire STL Pipeline updated its estimate of total construction costs to $262.0 million plus estimated Allowance for Funds Used During Construction of $24.9 million.  The drivers of the higher costs, compared to the previous estimate, include:

*

Retention of external partners for engineering, inspection, regulatory and other critical support services for the project

*

De-mobilizing and re-mobilizing construction crews

*

Additional work to repair right-of-way, more extensive restoration and repair of road damage and other impacts due to flooding

*

Additional horizontal directional drilling of two water bodies due to flooding

In the amended application filing, the recourse rate was raised to $0.36 per dekatherm from $0.27 per dekatherm. Spire also previously communicated that the negotiated rate under the precedent agreement with Spire Missouri Inc., the foundation shipper, could increase to $0.25 per dekatherm from $0.23 per dekatherm, based on an anticipated higher recourse rate.  It is anticipated that this negotiated rate will be adjusted in a subsequent filing after FERC approval of the amended application.

Spire anticipates that Spire STL Pipeline could be placed into commercial service as early as November 1, 2019, depending on how quickly flood conditions subside.

rate of interest to replace LIBOR giving consideration to prevailing market conventions. Until such replacement rate is determined,

borrowings under the Revolver Loan will bear interest at the ""Base Rate,"" which is the higher of (i) the Federal Funds

Rate plus fifty basis points and (ii) Berkshire's ""Prime Rate."" Under the Amended and Restated Note, the Company

accounts receivable, and (ii) the lesser of (a) 25% of eligible raw material inventory and (b) $250,000.  Under the Modification,

of eligible accounts receivable, (ii) the lesser of (a) 25% of eligible raw material inventory and (b) $250,000 and (iii) 50% of

On December 29, 2011, DAL Group, LLC (""DAL""), a subsidiary of DJSP Enterprises, Inc. (the ""Company""), and DAL Holding Company - DS, LLC (formerly Default Servicing, LLC) (the ""Target""), which is a subsidiary of DAL, entered into a First Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement (the ""Amendment"") by and among DAL, the Target, Homeland Security Capital Corporation (""HSCC"") and Default Servicing USA, Inc. (""Buyer""), which is a subsidiary of HSCC.  The Amendment amended that certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of June 22, 2011 (the ""Purchase Agreement""), which Purchase Agreement was described in and attached to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 23, 2011.  Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, DAL sold substantially all of the assets of the Target to Buyer for cash and certain future contingent payments.  Pursuant to the terms of the Amendment, DAL agreed to relinquish its rights to receive all future contingent payment amounts due and owing to the Target (as required under the terms of the Purchase Agreement) relating to the period from and after January 1, 2012, in consideration of a cash payment by the Buyer to the Target in the amount of $200,000.00.  The foregoing description of the Amendment and the agreements and transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete Amendment, a copy of which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1.

On December 30, 2011 (the ""Effective Date""), DAL Group, LLC (""Borrower""), a subsidiary of DJSP Enterprises, Inc. (the ""Company""), and Borrower's subsidiary, DJS Processing, LLC (""DJS""), as well as the Law Offices of David J. Stern, P.A. (the ""Law Offices"") and BA Note Acquisition LLC (""Lender""), entered into a Forbearance Agreement (the ""Forbearance Agreement"") pursuant to which Lender has agreed to forbear from exercising any of its available default rights and remedies, including not taking action to enforce payment of the principal and interest on Borrower's revolving line of credit (the ""Line of Credit""), which Line of Credit is evidenced in part by that certain Loan Agreement dated as of March 18, 2010, pursuant to which Lender's predecessor-in-interest, Bank of America, N.A., made a loan to Borrower in the original principal amount of $15,000,000.00,  through June 30, 2012, as long as Borrower makes weekly payments to Lender of cash held by Lender in its operating accounts in excess of agreed upon levels, as well as providing to Lender the proceeds of any sale not in the ordinary course of business and to which another secured creditor does not have a priority interest.  On the Effective Date, Borrower also paid Lender $650,000 to reduce its indebtedness to Lender under the Line of Credit.  During this forbearance period, Borrower and DJS are required to operate pursuant to an operating budget agreed upon by the parties.  Similarly, the Forbearance Agreement requires the Law Offices, the primary account receivable debtor of DJS, to operate pursuant to an operating budget and to make weekly payments to Lender of cash held by Law Offices in excess of agreed upon levels, which cash payments will be applied to reduce the amount of Law Office's indebtedness to DJS.  Such payments will be applied in turn to reduce amounts outstanding and due by Borrower and DJS under the Line of Credit to Lender.  The Law Offices also assigned to DJS and Lender the proceeds of any causes of action (less the cost of collection and a 10% consulting fee payable to David J. Stern) of Law Offices against its account debtors.  Because the Forbearance Agreement requires all Excess Cash (as defined in the Forbearance Agreement) of Borrower and its subsidiaries to be paid to Lender, in the event Borrower, DJS, or the Law Offices do not have sufficient cash to fund their expenses as set forth in their approved operating budgets, Lender may in its sole discretion make additional advances to them under the Line of Credit to fund such expenses, thereby increasing their respective debt obligations to Lender and DJS under the Line of Credit.  As of the Effective Date, the outstanding principal balance of the Line of Credit was $3,020,846.12.  Kerry S. Propper, a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, owns a non-controlling interest in Lender.  An affiliate of David J. Stern, the former Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, owns a non-controlling interest in Lender.  The foregoing description of the Forbearance Agreement and the agreements and transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete Forbearance Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.2.

On December 5, 2016, we issued a press

phage cocktail targeting  Staphylococcus aureus  ( S. aureus ) infections. Overall, treatment with AB-SA01 was well tolerated

when administered topically to the intact skin of healthy adults. The trial was conducted under a Collaborative Research and Development

Agreement with the U.S. Army at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Clinical Trials Center in Silver Spring, Maryland.

The double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety

of AB-SA01 administered topically to the intact skin of 12 healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 60. Volunteers were assigned

to receive either a low dose (1 x 10 8  PFU/mL) or a high dose (1 x 10 9  PFU/mL) of AB-SA01, administered topically

to the forearm. Placebo was similarly administered to the volunteer's opposite forearm, allowing each participant to serve

as his or her own control. The application sites were covered by an occlusive dressing for 24 hours. Participants received AB-SA01

and placebo daily for three consecutive days and were monitored for approximately two weeks following treatment.

Key findings from the study showed:

* No subject had a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) that was considered definitely or probably related to AB-SA01

* There were no severe or higher grade TEAEs, serious adverse events or discontinuation of treatment due to TEAEs

* Laboratory values and vital sign parameters were within normal ranges

* Treatment with AB-SA01 was well tolerated throughout the study

On December 8, 2015, Industrial Property Operating Partnership LP (the Borrower), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Industrial Property Trust Inc.

(the Company), amended and increased the amount of its existing $400.0 million credit facility by entering into a $500.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility) and a $250.0 million term loan facility (the

Term Facility), pursuant to that certain Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement (the Credit Facility Agreement) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent; Wells Fargo Bank, National

Association, as Syndication Agent; J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners; Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as Joint Lead Arranger; Bank of America, N.A.,

as Co-Documentation Agent; U.S. Bank National Association, as Joint Lead Arranger and Co-Documentation Agent; and Regions Bank, as Co-Documentation Agent (collectively, the Lenders). The Credit Facility Agreement provides the Borrower

with the ability from time to time to increase the size of the aggregate commitment made under the agreement by an additional $250.0 million up to a total of $1.0 billion, subject to receipt of lender commitments and other conditions. The maturity

date of the Revolving Facility is January 31, 2020, and may be extended pursuant to a one-year extension option, subject to continuing compliance with the financial covenants and other customary conditions and the payment of an extension fee.

The Term Facility may be drawn upon after the closing of the Credit Facility Agreement for a period of 180 days thereafter, and has a maturity date of January 31, 2021. At the Borrowers election, borrowings under the Credit Facility

Agreement will be charged interest based on (i) LIBOR multiplied by a statutory reserve rate plus a margin ranging from 1.40% to 2.30% for the Revolving Facility and 1.35% to 2.20% for the Term Facility, or (ii) an alternative base rate

plus a margin ranging from 0.40% to 1.30% for the Revolving Facility and 0.35% to 1.20% for the Term Facility, each depending on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio and whether the Company has received investment grade ratings. Borrowings

under the Credit Facility Agreement are available for general corporate purposes, including but not limited to the acquisition and operation of permitted investments. As of December 8, 2015, the amount outstanding under the Revolving Facility

was $200.0 million with an interest rate of 1.68%, and there was no amount outstanding under the Term Facility.    Borrowings under the Credit Facility

Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The Credit Facility Agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants, including covenants concerning: (i) consolidated tangible net worth;

(ii) consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio; (iii) consolidated leverage ratio; (iv) secured indebtedness; (v) secured recourse indebtedness; (vi) unencumbered interest coverage ratio; (vii) maximum unencumbered

property pool leverage ratio; and (viii) unencumbered property pool criteria.    In addition, the Credit Facility Agreement contains customary

affirmative and negative covenants, which, among other things, require the Borrower to deliver to the Lenders specified quarterly and annual financial information, and limit the Borrower and/or the Company, subject to various exceptions and

thresholds from: (i) creating liens (other than certain permitted liens) on the unencumbered asset pool; (ii) merging with other companies (other than certain permitted mergers); (iii) selling all or substantially all of its assets or

properties; (iv) transferring a material interest in the Borrower; (v) entering into certain transactions with affiliates, unless such transactions are on terms obtainable on arms-length transactions; (vi) making certain types of

investments; and (vii) if in default under the Credit Facility Agreement, paying certain distributions.    The Credit Facility Agreement permits

voluntary prepayment of principal and accrued interest and contains various customary events of default, which are described therein. As is customary in such financings, if an event of default occurs under the Credit Facility Agreement, the Lenders

may accelerate the repayment of amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility Agreement and exercise other remedies subject, in certain instances, to the expiration of an applicable cure period.

oking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.            I too am a long time Torvec shareholder. I would like to take this opportunity to express our thanks to all of your for you continued support. Not only did you overwhelmingly endorse current management with over 99% of the votes cast. You did so with one of the highest percentages of votes cast at any Torvec annual meeting ---- 91%.  James Y. Gleasman:                      I am proud to stand here tonight to tell you that, after ten years of innovative product development, Torvec is no longer a research and development company.  Let me repeat: for the first time, in 2006, all of Torvec's core automotive products are now ready for production.  The FTV is ready for production and in 2006, we equipped the vehicle with a Cummins 4-cylinder, 3.9 liter, 170 horsepower, turbo-charged diesel engine. The IsoTorque differential is ready for production and in 2006, we successfully demo

nstrated our 300 horsepower IsoTorque units in Nissan motorsports 350Z racing cars  at the Willow Springs Raceway outside of Los Angeles. We have sent completed units to Nissan for integration with Nissan racing cars and have been told by Nissan to be prepared for an order for 20 to 30 IsoTorque units. The IVT is ready for production and is being adapted for installation in regulation-size schools buses as part of our school-bus program and for integration and compatibility testing by NASA in connection with NASA's plan to establish a permanent lunar settlement. The constant velocity joint is ready for production and has been shown to numerous visitors. Since our products are now ready for production, numerous governmental and company officials, both foreign and domestic, have been able to visit our facilities in Webster to experience our technologies first-hand.             There is another, equally important reason companies and government officials are flocking to our door. In the past, I ha

ve told you and forecasted that certain cosmic events were emerging on the world-stage that would force the automotive industry to look upon our technologies in a new, more favorable light. These socio-economic events are no longer futuristic. These events are here now and are shattering the entrenched complacency and desire on the part of the worldwide auto industry to maintain the status quo.                First, while everyone knows that China is emerging as an economic world power, few have realized until now that its emergence is a two-way street: yes, China is becoming an enormous buyer of our goods and services; however, China is also is rapidly invading our markets and competing with our companies for market dominance. This is causing ever-increasing pressure on the supply and demand for raw materials ---- e.g. steel, aluminum, copper and OIL.              Another major shift affecting the auto industry is the flat-out demand for non-polluting products --- the demand for GREEN ENERGY i

s here and now. This trend can not be postponed ---- the year 2007 is not some far off, distant time. It is THIS YEAR.              A third event that has shaken the industry is the demand of the average consumer for safer, more fuel-efficient vehicles. This is a fact of life that will not go away.              Dana, Delphi and Ford Motor Company have paid the penalty for ignoring these cosmic events affecting their own industry. Other companies are beginning to respond to the pressures and are hoping to be able to respond to the crisis before it is too late.                 The result of these emerging world trends and the completion of our products to a PRODUCTION READY STAGE is converging. Our products are now ready and the auto industry is now realizing that we have the ONLY ECONOMIC SOLUTION to deal with these major events confronting them.                I stand here tonight with the utmost confidence that ultimately, success will be ours. I believe that our overall stra

tegy will result in revenue-producing events for our shareholders.  WHAT IS OUR STRATEGY?   SIMPLE: TO CHALLENGE THE AUTO INDUSTRY IN THE MARKET PLACE AND THUS BECOME A COMPETITIVE THREAT SO THAT THE INDUSTRY IS COMPELLED TO PAY OUR SHAREHOLDERS WHAT THIS TECHNOLOGY IS TRULY WORTH.                Now, with these thoughts as background, I would like to reviewour accomplishments over the 2006 year. A. Ongoing Dialogue with Numerous Public and Private Enterprises                IN THE LIGHT OF WHAT I JUST SAID, it should come as no surprise that one of our major accomplishments during 2006 was the showcasing of our production-ready products to numerous auto companies and governmental leaders. Since April, 2006, representatives of over twenty companies, including the Chinese and Japanese, as well as local, state and national officials have visited our facility in Webster, New York to experience our technology first hand. We announced a number of t

hese meetings in our various CEO Updates on our website during the course of this spring and summer. The next slides show you many of the people we have talked to over the last eight months!!  I can tell you that all have been enthusiastic and we will be sharing with you the results of a number of these discussions later tonight. B. Launching of School Bus Program                 On May 5, 2006, we launched our New York State and National School Bus Program, which calls for the retrofit of up to 55,000 New York State and up to an additional 500,000 school buses nationwide with our IVT and IsoTorque differential.                 In October, we announced we had engaged American Continental Group, LLC to provide us with professionally competent governmental relations and public affairs representation before various federal and state departments and agencies, especially with congressional delegations, the White House, the Governor's Office and the Departments of Energy, Defense an

d NYCERTA.                  I can tell you tonight that our efforts are meeting with success---we have formally presented our school bus program to Senator Hillary Clinton's staff in Washington and at the request of the Senator's office, a major defense contractor and Torvec will explore the applicability of our technology to the prototype it is designing at the Defense Department's request for the next generation Humvee.                  We will have more to tell you about our school bus program later tonight.                             C. NASA Project                 During the fall of 2006, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) requested that we visit its facilities at the Johnson Space Center in Houston to consult NASA officials on the drive-line products necessary for the next generation Lunar Rover.  As a result of these meetings, Torvec was commissioned by NASA to develop an IVT which can be integrated with the Lunar Rover an

d suitable for the rather hostile environment of the Moon. I want to stress that NASA came to Torvec ---- not the other way around --- because NASA had concluded, after an exhaustive, worldwide search, that Torvec has the only IVT technology that meets NASA's performance, stringent packaging and control specifications.                The completed prototype is available for your inspection tonight.  I am again very proud of Torvec's engineers who accomplished the near-impossible by getting this transmission ready for shipment to NASA well ahead of the deadline submitted by NASA.   D. Five-Year Stock Performance Chart                  All investment advisers, brokerage houses, mutual fund managers use what are called ""indexes"" to compare the relative performance of stocks over a selected period of time --- one year, five years, ten years and the like. The SEC requires public companies, such as Torvec, to publish a comparison of the performance of

our stock on a total return basis with comparable, broad-based indexes as well as with an industry-wide index over the most recent five-year period.  We now show you a comparison of the performance of Torvec's common stock over the five year period January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2006 as against the performance of the S&P Small Cap 600, the S&P 500, the NASDAQ Composite, the Russell 2000, the Russell 3000 and the Russell MicroCap. The numbers on the screen show you what your total return would have been if you had invested $100 in Torvec common stock at the beginning of 2002 versus what your total return would have been had you invested $100 at the beginning of 2002 in other companies, as measured by these indexes. And, it is important to realize that this analysis was not done by Torvec but by Research Data Group, Inc., a Standard and Poor's licensed company with over 1500 clients such as Microsoft, The NASDAQ Stock Market, Cisco, Nike, Starbucks and Outback Steakhouse. Research Dat

a guarantees that its methodology is in complete compliance with all SEC regulations.                   I now will turn the program over to Keith to tell you where we stand today on a number of exciting projects. Keith Gleasman: A. The NASA Program            1. NASA invited us to the Johnson Space Center to review our transmission technology with top NASA engineers. Our discussions resulted in our engagement by NASA to conduct a feasibility study as to the integration of six of our IVTS and IsoTorque differentials in the rover;           2. After reviewing all existing transmission technologies worldwide, NASA has hired Torvec, because its IVT could meet the stringent performance, packaging and control requirements dictated by NASA for installation in NASA's next generation lunar rover.              3. NASA  agreed to compensate Torvec for its efforts on a time and materials basis to design and build a modified version of our IVT for use

with the lunar rover but demanded that NASA receive delivery of the first unit no later than February 15, 2007. As you can see, thanks to the fabulous work of our engineering staff, we will be shipping the unit you see here tonight to NASA, well ahead of  schedule;           4. NASA's planned return to the moon is scheduled for 2020. Their program calls for the development of a series of lunar rovers - first generation, second generation, third generation and so on. NASA has asked us to provide quotations for Torvec to build 7 IVTS and 7 IsoTorques for installation in the first generation lunar rover. We expect that Torvec will be asked to quote on all successive generations as NASA's lunar rover project develops.            5. This project initially will generate hundreds of thousands of dollars to Torvec.  NASA's commitment to Torvec's technologies absolutely validates, if anyone had any questions, what we have been saying about our technologies for year

s. No longer is it simply Jim and myself telling you that our technologies are the best in the world. NASA has provided us ---- and has provided all you shareholders --- with proof positive that this is the case.   B. Koenigsegg              Koenigsegg is a Swedish manufacturer with a worldwide  reputation for producing one of  the most advanced and certainly one of the most expensive cars in the world  --- a sticker price of $700,000. We have entered into a development program with Koenigsegg. I can not share with you much more  about this exciting project tonight due to the dentiality agreement between Torvec and Koenigsegg. I now want to introduce Michael Palumbo, chief operating officer of Flaum Manaagement, LLC., one of the most successful real estate development firms in the entire upstate New York region.  As you recall, David Flaum joined our board of directors  last August and, of course, you have reelected David for a full term as a director

tonight. Michael has been instrumental is helping us implement our school bus program and I would like him to share with you some of the most recent developments on this exciting project.   Michael Palumbo:   A.  The New York State and National School Bus Program            You are all probably aware that last April, Torvec announced its school bus program and presented the program to numerous New York State and federal officials.           The proposal has met with enthusiastic response from local, state and national governmental officials because it will drastically lower fuel costs (at least 25%), dramatically reduce diesel pollution and increase the safety of our children --- while at the same saving New York State's taxpayers over $400,000,000 during the life of the program!!             The implementation of the program will require that Torvec acquires a facility to enable us to install and test the IVT and IsoTorque differential in regula

tion-size school buses, acquire all the equipment, parts and suppliers necessary to build the IVTS and IsoTorques. Torvec will also have to acquire a dynamometer big enough to test the IVT in regulation-size school buses.    Jim has already shared with you that we just completed a meeting with Senator Hillary Clinton's staff in Washington.  The Senators staff is very supportive on the bus plan and wished to see it succeed in NYS            Torvec is not only attracting interest from New York State and Washington officials. I will now turn the program back to Jim.  James Y. Gleasman: A. The Chinese; American First Tier Supplier             Our discussions with the Chinese began in April, 2004 and  were focused on the FTV. The discussions involved various Chinese delegations visiting us, seeing the FTV operate and seeing all of our technologies. We visited the Chinese, specifically Shanghai Automotive, in June, 2005. Shanghai Automotive visited us

in December, 2005 and yet again in May, 2006 ---- again, with the discussions centered on Shanghai's acquisition of the FTV.                In June, 2006, something extraordinary happened. Philip Murtaugh, former head of GM-Asia, became one of the very top officers of Shanghai.  The interesting point for Torvec shareholders is that we had been talking independently to Mr. Murtaugh for more than a year about ALL of our technologies.                Consequently, as soon as Mr. Murtaugh assumed the reins at Shanghai, the discussions shifted to the license of all of our technologies or, in the alternative, the acquisition of Torvec by Shanghai.                 These discussions culminated in Shanghai sending a delegation, headed by Phil Murtaugh, to our facilities in late November. The delegation consisted of Shanghai Automotive's best engineers and engineers from Shanghai's Korean subsidiary, Sangyong.                The delegation spent one entire week with us, b

oth reviewing our technology as well as discussing the terms and conditions of an acquisition. The Chinese expressed interest in our school bus program and in forming a strategic partnership with Torvec. More concretely, they asked us to provide them with our entire patent portfolio to enable them to begin the process of evaluating Torvec for an acquisition.                 I would like to read a portion of an e-mail sent to us by Mr. Murtaugh specifically making this request: ""YOU WILL RECALL THAT DURING OUR MEETINGIN NEW YORK, I HAD INDICATED THAT SAIC MAY BE INTERESTED IN PURSUING DISCUSSIONS WITH TORVEC ON THE PURCHASE OF LICENSES REGARDING THE TECHNOLOGIES WE HAVE DISCUSSED, i. e. THE CVJOINT, ISOTORQUE DIFFERENTIAL, IVT AND FTV, OR THE OUTRIGHT PURCHASE OF TORVEC. IN ORDER FOR US TO DO AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION FOR THIS PURPOSE, I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST THAT TORVEC SUPPLY US WITH A LIST OF THE US PATENTS COVERING THESE TECHNOLOGIES, AND A LIST OF OVERSEAS PATENTS THAT APPLY.""

Needless to say, Torvec did furnish SAIC with the requested patent list.             Obviously, one important element in any Chinese deal will be the issue of providing the Chinese with exclusive manufacturing rights to our technology. Thus, a Chinese deal will probably involve Chinese manufacturing in China.             On the other hand, all of the politicians we have talked to are adamant that financial support for Torvec, especially Torvec's school bus program, will be conditioned on job creation in the United States, in New York, and more specifically, in Monroe and adjourning counties.                 I am also here to tell you that, quite recently a major, and I mean major, American, tier one supplier has entered the war with a vengeance.                This brings us full circle. I told you at the beginning of tonight's meeting that the Chinese present American companies with a dilemma --- the opportunity to sell in China; but, equally

truly, the Chinese ability and willingness to compete for market share. The American first-tier supplier freely admitted to us when they visited that the Chinese ""have become their mortal enemy"" and they were looking at our technology to give them an extraordinary competitive edge against the Chinese invasion. Thus, very quickly, the discussions have reached what could be called the ""end-stage."" This means that the American first-tier supplier requested us to furnish them with an evaluation of all of our technologies) so that they could formulate a proposal to acquire all of Torvec. We are now in the process of preparing this evaluation.             Since both companies are bound by a strict confidentiality agreement, I can not divulge much more at this time. Just in case you are skeptical about the existence and breadth of this agreement, I would just like to read a few excerpts from the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement we have signed with the American first-tier supplier and others: ""THE INT

ENT OF THIS AGREEMENT IS FOR PARTIES TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF ENGAGING IN A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL TRANSACTION AND TO PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIAL NATURE OF ANY PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL TECHNICAL AND BUSINESS INFORMATION THAT MAY BE EXCHANGED.  'CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION' SHALL MEAN ANY AND ALL BUSINESS, TECHNICAL , AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PURPOSE OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, PRODUCTS, SPECIFICATIONS, FORMULAE, EQUIPMENT, BUSINESS STRATEGIES, CUSTOMER LISTS, KNOW-HOW, DRAWINGS, PRICING INFORMATION, INVENTIONS, IDEAS ALL OTHER INFORMATION THAT IS OWNED BY THE RESPECTIVE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT.   DISSEMINATION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION SHALL BE LIMITED TO EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS THAT ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED WITH THE DISCUSSIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AND EVEN THEN ONLY TO SUCH EXTENT AS IS NECESSARY AND ESSENTIAL.""               I can divulge that the proposal that is on the table between the two companies is a stock-swap in which

Torvec shareholders would receive the first-tier supplier's publicly-traded stock for Torvec common stock. Let me once again explain to you why your management feels a stock-swap with a publicly-traded buyer is the most advantageous approach for Torvec's acquisition.                 First, the transaction is non-taxable to you as shareholders;                 Second, the transaction will result in an immediate and significantincrease in the value of your shares;                Third, the transaction enables all of us as shareholders to profit by the successful commercialization of Torvec's  technologies through sharing in the appreciation of the stock of the acquiring company;                Fourth, the transaction enables shareholders to share in any dividends declared by the first-tier supplier ( and it does have a history of paying dividends);                   Fifth, the transaction will enable us avoid to often

painstaking and costly nightmare of accounting for and auditing the payment of royalties year after year during the term of any license.                   It is very important that all our shareholders understand that our discussions with the first-tier supplier (as well as our ongoing discussions with other companies ) are NOT focused upon the viability, ""workability"" or ""functionality"" of our products. As a top executive with over 37 years of driveline experience with GM and Ford said recently: ""Your transmission will rule the world.""               The issue now, and in a way always has been, what the technology worth is and how much is a buyer willing to pay for it. The difference today from the past is that no one now is playing games by telling us that we need to PROVE that our technology works. The question, then, for your management is to decide is what is a fair and adequate price for all of Torvec's technology.                 Let me first assure you that we have done our ho

mework and have a very good idea of the range of prices per share that would be acceptable to your board of direct ors and senior management. However, in pursuit of our own due diligence, we thought it might be interesting to hear from you as to what price per share each of you think would be fair and adequate for a sale of all of Torvec's technologies.                We are passing out a ""ballot"" of sorts, asking you to jot down a price per share you would be willing to accept on a buy out. Please do not sign your name since we want this to be anonymous. And, please know that this is simply a very informal survey - nothing more. The results of the survey have no legal or other impact ---- we simply want to get an idea of your thinking as we move forward.                                  We will collate your answers and publish the results on our website --- www.torvec.com---- in the near future. F. Conclusion                   Before we open the meeting for our traditio

nal question and answer session, I would like to express a couple of closing thoughts. First, our confidence that Torvec will be successful has never wavered. The combination of our products and the scio-economic conditions I talked about at the beginning of our meeting has set the stage for our ultimate success.                    We are positive in our resolve to be successful and tough enough to persevere despite difficulties. Our attitude is not one of fear, uncertainty or doubt.                  I am reminded of what Eleanor Roosevelt told the former President when he expressed doubt about his ability to win the presidency. He had said - ""I am afraid to try because I might fail."" She replied --- Well, then don't."" He looked puzzled and asked - ""What, don't try?"" Eleanor responded firmly: ""NO, DON'T FAIL.""                   I can assure you, we have no fear of failing.

with the $23,000,000 in aggregate amount of financing contemplated by the other

commitment letters, is to replace the Financing Agreement, dated as of February 14,

guarantor), certain lenders party thereto and U.S. Bank National Association, as

to the Special

3

Committee.

Either the Company, on

the one hand, or Parent and the Merger Sub, on the other hand, may terminate

the Merger Agreement in certain specified circumstances.  The Merger Agreement contains, in addition to

customary termination rights, the following termination rights:

(1)                                    Either party may terminate the Merger

Agreement if the Merger does not become effective prior to the earlier of (a) 10

days following the Companys stockholders meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement

(the  Stockholders Meeting ) or (b) 180

days after the date of the Merger Agreement (in each case, so long as any

failure of the terminating party to perform the Merger Agreement has not been

the principal cause or resulted in the failure of the Merger to become

effective prior to such date).  The

Company is required to pay Parent a $2,000,000 termination fee if Parent

exercises this termination right and all of the conditions to the Companys obligation

to close have been satisfied.  Parent is

required to pay Company a $2,000,000 termination fee if the Company exercises

this termination right and all of the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs

obligation to close (other than the financing condition) have been satisfied.  The Company is required to pay Parent a

$2,000,000 termination fee if any party exercises this termination right

following a public proposal from a third party relating to an

alternative business combination transaction and a business combination transaction involving the Company is, within

nine months of termination, consummated or entered into (and subsequently

consummated).

(2)                                    The Company is required to pay Parent a

$2,000,000 termination fee if (a) the Merger Agreement is terminated,

following a public proposal from a third party relating to any

alternative business combination transaction, because approval from the Companys stockholders is not obtained at the

Stockholders Meeting and (b) a business combination transaction involving

the Company is, within nine months of termination, consummated or entered into

(and subsequently consummated).

(3)                                    Parent and Merger Sub may terminate the

Merger Agreement if (a) the Companys board of directors changes its recommendation to the

Stockholders Meeting or approves a third party proposal relating to an

alternative business combination transaction or (b) the Company fails to

hold the Stockholders Meeting within 45

days after the applicable proxy statement is cleared by the Securities and

Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).  If Parent and Merger Sub exercise this

termination right, the Company is required to pay Parent a $2,000,000

termination fee.

(4)                                    The Company may terminate the Merger

Agreement if any of the Commitment Letters expires or is terminated and Parent

is unable to obtain new commitment letters within 21 days of expiration or

termination.  If the Company exercises

this termination right, Parent is required to pay Company a $2,000,000

termination fee.

(5)                                    The Company may terminate the Merger

Agreement if the financing condition cannot be satisfied within 10 days after

the Company obtains stockholder approval at the Stockholders Meeting.  If the Company exercises this termination

right and all of the other conditions to Parents and Merger Subs obligation

to close have been satisfied, Parent is required to pay Company a $2,000,000

termination fee.

4

(6)                                    The Company may terminate the Merger

Agreement if Parent has not delivered the Aggregated Commitment Letter within

21 days after the date of the Merger Agreement.

If the Company exercises this termination right, no termination fee is

payable.

(7)                                    Parent

and Merger Sub may terminate the Merger Agreement if any lender party to the

Financing Agreement exercises any material remedies available to it by reason

of an event of default under the Financing Agreement.  If Parent and Merger Sub exercise this

termination right, no termination fee is payable.

On June 19, 2006,  Blue  Holdings,  Inc.  entered into an Agreement and

Plan of Merger (""Merger Agreement"") among LR Acquisition Corporation, a District

of Columbia corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary (""LR Acquisition""), Long

Rap, Inc., a District of Columbia  corporation (""Long Rap""), the stockholders of

Long Rap and Charles  Rendelman,  as the Long Rap stockholders'  representative,

pursuant  to which  Long Rap will  merge  with and into LR  Acquisition  with LR

Acquisition  surviving the merger. The consideration payable by us in connection

with the merger  consists of  $16,000,000 in cash and shares of our common stock

having a value of $16,000,000  based on the average  closing price of our common

stock during the 10-day trading period immediately  preceding the effective time

of the merger  (collectively  the ""Merger  Consideration"").  Each stockholder of

Long  Rap  will  receive  its   proportionate   share  of  the  cash  and  stock

consideration payable under the merger agreement as Merger Consideration,  based

on such  stockholder's  percentage  ownership of Long Rap's outstanding  capital

stock.

Notwithstanding  the above,  the aggregate  share portion of the Merger

Consideration (the ""Share Consideration"") to be issued at the closing will in no

event represent in excess of 19.99% of our voting power outstanding  immediately

prior to the effective time of the merger, or otherwise equal a number of shares

of our  common  stock in excess of 19.99% of the  number of shares of our common

stock issued and  outstanding  immediately  prior to the  effective  time of the

merger.  If, as a result  of the  foregoing  limitation,  the value of the Share

Consideration to be issued at the closing is less than $16,000,000, then we will

pay the difference, i.e., $16,000,000 less the value of the Share Consideration,

in cash,  provided  that  such  cash  payment  does  not  adversely  affect  the

determination  of the merger as a  ""reorganization""  under Section 368(a) of the

Code.  In  the  event  that  any  such  payment  would   adversely   affect  the

determination  of the Merger as a  ""reorganization""  under Section 368(a) of the

Code,  then  the  Merger  shall  be  abandoned  and the  Merger  Agreement  will

terminate.

At the effective time of the merger,  the articles of incorporation and

bylaws of LR Acquisition will be the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the

surviving company, except that such articles of incorporation will be amended to

change the name of the surviving  company to ""Long Rap,  Inc."" Each  outstanding

share of the  capital  stock of Long Rap  will be  converted  into the  right to

receive a proportionate share of the Merger  Consideration,  and each issued and

outstanding  share of the common stock of LR Acquisition  will remain issued and

outstanding   and  shall   represent   one  validly   issued,   fully  paid  and

non-assessable  share of the common stock of the surviving  company.  The merger

will become  effective upon the filing and acceptance of articles of merger with

the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs of the District of Columbia in

accordance with the District of Columbia Business Corporation Act.

The consummation of the merger is conditioned on, among other customary

requirements, the registration of the shares of our common stock to be issued as

Merger  Consideration  to holders of outstanding  shares of the capital stock of

Long Rap, our  completion of due diligence of Long Rap, the delivery by Long Rap

of the audited  financial  statements  of Long Rap, and our  obtaining  adequate

financing  to fund the cash portion of the Merger  Consideration  payable to the

stockholders  of Long Rap  under the  Merger  Agreement  and to obtain  adequate

working capital to fund both our and Long Rap's operations post-merger.

At the  effective  time of the merger,  we will  deposit into an escrow

fund a portion of the Merger  Consideration  equal to $1,000,000 and a number of

shares of our common  stock having a value of  $1,000,000  (based on the average

closing price of our common stock during the 10-day trading  period  immediately

preceding the effective  time of the merger) as security for claims for which we

may seek indemnification under the Merger Agreement.

Each of Long Rap's  stockholders  agreed to execute a lock-up agreement

at the closing of the merger pursuant to which each such  stockholder will agree

not to offer,  sell,  assign,  transfer,  pledge or  otherwise  dispose  of such

stockholder's  shares of our common stock acquired as Merger Consideration for a

period of 24 months after the  effective  time of the merger except for the sale

or transfer  of up to 50,000  shares of our common  stock in each 90-day  period

after the first anniversary of the effective time of the merger, the transfer of

up to 125,000 shares per stockholder to specified advisors and employees of Long

Rap, and the transfer of shares of our common  stock to family  members,  trusts

and other entities for estate planning purposes.

We agreed to  indemnify  Long Rap's  stockholders  and  certain of Long

Rap's  affiliates  against damages  incurred by or asserted against such parties

based  upon or  resulting  from (i)  taxes for which  certain  liabilities  were

accrued  or  reserved  as of  April  30,  2006 and  taxes  accrued  or  reserved

subsequent  to such date in the ordinary  course of  business,  (ii) third party

claims  relating to any  liability or obligation of Long Rap accrued or reserved

as of April 30,  2006 or  accrued  or  reserved  subsequent  to such date in the

ordinary course of business (other than specified  liabilities disclosed to us),

(iii) any liability or  obligation of a stockholder  as a guarantor or surety as

to payment or performance of Long Rap's  obligations  under its existing  credit

facility  or any  other  guaranty  liability  or  obligation  set  forth  in the

applicable  section  of Long  Rap's  disclosure  letter,  and (iv) any breach or

inaccuracy of any representation,  warranty or covenant made by us in the Merger

Agreement and exhibits and schedules  thereto,  and any cost or expense  related

thereto, for all amounts in excess of $200,000.

Our aggregate  liability for losses incurred under the Merger Agreement

is  $500,000,  except  (i) with  respect  to any  breach of our  representations

regarding the valid issuance of shares to be issued as Merger  Consideration  or

our authority to consummate  the merger,  which results in the forfeiture of any

of the Merger Consideration  received by Long Rap's stockholders,  in which case

our aggregate  liability shall be limited to the amount of Merger  Consideration

forfeited  plus  reasonable  costs  and  expenses,   or  (ii)  breaches  of  our

representations   regarding  our  filings  with  the   Securities  and  Exchange

Commission and financial  statements,  in which case our aggregate liability for

losses shall be $5,400,000  less the aggregate value of the shares of our common

stock issued in the merger based on a formula specified in the Merger Agreement.

These  limitations  are not  applicable in instances of fraud on our part or for

losses in connection  with taxes,  third party claims or guarantees for which we

have agreed to indemnify Long Rap's stockholders.

Long Rap's  stockholders  agreed to indemnify us, the surviving company

and certain of our affiliates  against damages  incurred or asserted against us,

the surviving company or certain of our affiliates based upon or resulting from:

(i) taxes (except taxes for which certain  liabilities  were accrued or reserved

as of April 30, 2006,  and taxes accrued or reserved  subsequent to such date in

the ordinary course of business) owed prior to the effective date of the merger,

(ii) third party  claims  against  Long Rap or the  surviving  company,  whether

arising  before or after the effective  time of the merger but related solely to

facts,  events or  circumstances  in  existence  or occurring on or prior to the

effective  time of the merger  (except to the extent  accrued or  reserved as of

April 30, 2006 or accrued or reserved  subsequent  to such date in the  ordinary

course of business),  and (iii) any breach or inaccuracy of any  representation,

warranty or covenant  made by Long Rap in the Merger  Agreement and exhibits and

schedules thereto,  and any cost or expense related thereto,  for all amounts in

excess of $200,000.

Each  stockholder's  aggregate  liability for losses incurred under the

Merger Agreement is $1.8 million  (inclusive of 1/3 of the portion of the Merger

Consideration deposited into the escrow account),  except with respect to losses

arising   from  any  breach  of  Long  Rap's   representations   regarding   its

capitalization  or  authority  to  consummate  the  merger,  in which  case each

stockholder's  aggregate  liability  will not  exceed  the  value of the  Merger

Consideration received by such stockholder. These limitations are not applicable

in  instances  of  fraud  by  Long  Rap or its  stockholders  or for  losses  in

connection  with taxes or third party  claims for which Long Rap's  stockholders

have agreed to indemnify us.

We may terminate the Merger  Agreement  with Long Rap's mutual  written

consent  provided that such  termination is authorized by our board of directors

and Long Rap's board of directors.  The Merger  Agreement may also be terminated

by us or Long Rap if:  the  closing  of the  merger  does not occur on or before

September 30, 2006; any permanent  injunction or other order of a court or other

competent  government  entity  preventing the consummation of the merger becomes

final and  non-appealable;  or it is  determined  by tax counsel that the merger

will not  qualify  as a  reorganization  under  Section  368(a) of the  Internal

Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  We may terminate the Merger Agreement if Long

Rap breaches,  which breach remains uncured for 10 days after receipt of written

notice from us of such  breach,  any  representations,  warranties  or covenants

contained in the Merger Agreement that would result in the failure of any of the

conditions  to the  closing of the  merger  set forth in the  Merger  Agreement,

provided that we are not in material  breach of the Merger  Agreement.  Long Rap

may terminate the Merger  Agreement if we breach,  which breach remains  uncured

for 10 days after  receipt of written  notice from Long Rap of such breach,  any

representations,  warranties or covenants contained in the Merger Agreement that

would  result in the  failure  of any of the  conditions  to the  closing of the

merger  set  forth in the  Merger  Agreement,  provided  that Long Rap is not in

material breach of the Merger  Agreement.  In certain  termination  events,  the

terminating  party may be entitled to a termination  fee equal to $50,000 (plus,

with  respect to us,  one-half  of Long  Rap's  audit  expenses  in the event we

terminate or the deal does not close due to reasons other than Long Rap's or its

stockholders' breach), or additionally in our case, if we terminate because Long

Rap  or  its  stockholders  breach  their  obligations  with  respect  to  other

proposals, or as a result of their refusal to consummate the merger, we would be

entitled to a termination fee equal to $300,000.

During  the  period  from the date of the  Merger  Agreement  until the

earlier of the termination of the Merger  Agreement or the effective time of the

merger,  Long Rap has  covenanted to conduct its business in the usual,  regular

and ordinary course in substantially the same manner as previously conducted and

not to solicit,  accept or participate in discussions  regarding any proposal or

offer from any person relating to a possible acquisition transaction.

Other than in respect of the Merger Agreement, the parties thereto have

ceeds of the foregoing:

(iii)          all of Western's owned equipment, including all machinery, vehicles, furniture, fixtures, manufacturing equipment, shop equipment, office and recordkeeping equipment, parts, telephone systems, tools and supplies; provided, however, Providential will not acquire: any leased equipment unless Providential assumes the applicable lease and such is assigned by order of the Bankruptcy Court;

(""Starwood"") issued a press release announcing that Starwood's Board of Directors, in consultation with its legal and financial advisors, determined that a revised non-binding proposal from a consortium consisting of Anbang Insurance Group Co., Ltd., J.C. Flowers & Co. and Primavera Capital Limited (the ""Consortium""), to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Starwood common stock (the ""Consortium Proposal"") is reasonably likely to lead to a Starwood Superior Proposal (as defined in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 15, 2015, as amended by Amendment Number 1 to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 20, 2016 (the ""Merger Agreement""), by and among Starwood, Marriott International, Inc. (""Marriott""), Solar Merger Sub 1, Inc., Solar Merger Sub 2, Inc., Mars Merger Sub, Inc. and Mars Merger Sub, LLC).

On March 26, 2016, Starwood received a non-binding proposal from the Consortium, under which the Consortium would acquire all of the outstanding shares of Starwood common stock for $81.00 per share in cash. Starwood's Board of Directors, in consultation with its legal and financial advisors, determined that this proposal is reasonably likely to lead to a Starwood Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement), allowing Starwood to engage in discussions with, and provide diligence information to, the Consortium in connection with the Consortium Proposal. Starwood commenced discussions with the Consortium on March 26, 2016 and, in those discussions, the Consortium made a revised proposal with an increased purchase price of $82.75 in cash per share of Starwood common stock. Starwood and the Consortium are continuing to discuss non-price terms related to the Consortium Proposal, and are working to finalize the other terms of a binding proposal from the Consortium, including definitive documentation.

Starwood's Board of Directors, in consultation with its legal and financial advisors, will carefully consider the outcome of its discussions with the Consortium in order to determine the course of action that is in the best interest of Starwood and its stockholders.  There can be no assurance that discussions will result in a binding proposal from the Consortium, that Starwood's Board of Directors will determine that any such proposal is a Starwood Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or that a transaction with the Consortium will be approved or consummated on any particular terms or at all.

As previously announced, Starwood intends to convene its stockholder meeting to consider the merger with Marriott on March 28, 2016, and immediately adjourn the meeting until April 8, 2016. Starwood's Board of Directors has not changed its recommendation in support of Starwood's merger with Marriott.

On May 10, 2016, Gaiam entered into two definitive agreements pursuant to which Gaiam has agreed to sell all of Gaiams assets and liabilities

primarily related to, or used in, the Brand Business (as defined below) (the Brand Business Sale).    Pursuant to the term of a Membership

Interest Purchase Agreement (the Brand Purchase Agreement) with Stretch & Bend Holdings, LLC (Brand Purchaser) and its direct parent, Sequential Brands Group, Inc. (Brand Purchaser Parent), subject to the

satisfaction of closing conditions described below, Gaiam will sell all of the equity interests in Gaiam Brand Holdco, LLC (Brand Holdco, and, together with its subsidiaries, the Brand Companies) to Brand Purchaser. At the

time of the closing of the Brand Business Sale, Brand Holdco will hold, directly or indirectly through its subsidiaries, all of Gaiams assets and liabilities primarily related to, or used in, Gaiams fitness, yoga and wellness consumer

products business (the Brand Business), other than the assets and liabilities subject to the FFL Purchase Agreement (as defined below).

Pursuant to the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement (the FFL Purchase Agreement) with Fit for Life LLC (FFL Purchaser), subject to

the satisfaction of closing conditions described below, FFL Purchaser will purchase from the Brand Companies, and Gaiam will cause the Brand Companies to sell to FFL Purchaser, (i) inventory, (ii) accounts receivable, and (iii) all

other physical assets, including, without limitation, equipment, furniture and other operating assets, in each case, related to each such Brand Companys business. In addition, FFL Purchaser will assume (a) certain trade payables of the

Brand Companies, (b) all liabilities and obligations arising from or related to the acquired assets in respect of the periods before, on or after the closing date, but only to the extent that such liabilities and obligations thereunder are

required to be performed after the closing date, were incurred in the ordinary course of business and do not relate to any failure to perform, improper performance, warranty or other breach, default or violation by Gaiam or any of the Brand

Companies on or before the closing of the FFL Sale, and (c) all liabilities and obligations of Gaiam Americas, Inc. under the lease agreement with Boulder Road LLC. Brand Purchaser expects to license certain rights and transfer certain assets

Louisville, Colorado 80027, Attention: Secretary, Gaiam, Inc.    Description of the Brand Purchase Agreement

Under the Brand Purchase Agreement, Brand Purchaser agreed to pay Gaiam $145,700,000 in cash, subject to adjustments at closing and post-closing for cash and

cash equivalents, indebtedness and transaction expenses. At the closing, Brand Purchaser will deposit a portion of the purchase price equal to $5,010,000 into an escrow account to be held by a third party escrow agent. Brand Purchaser will pay

estimated net cash consideration to Gaiam at the closing equal to the $145,700,000 purchase price, minus the escrowed amount described above, minus the Brand Companies estimated indebtedness, plus the Brand Companies estimated closing

cash and cash equivalents, and minus the Brand Companies estimated unpaid transaction expenses (including any change of control bonus payments). After the closing, the parties will calculate the final net cash consideration, using the

calculation for estimated net cash consideration described above, based on the actual closing amounts of the Brand Companies indebtedness, cash and cash equivalents and unpaid transaction expenses. If the final net cash consideration is

greater than the estimated net cash consideration paid at the closing, Brand Purchaser shall pay a cash amount equal to the excess to Gaiam within three business days of such determination, and Gaiam and Brand Purchaser shall deliver a joint

instruction to the escrow agent to distribute all funds remaining in the escrow account to Gaiam. If the final net cash consideration is less than the estimated net cash consideration paid at the closing, Gaiam and Brand Purchaser shall deliver a

joint instruction to the escrow agent to distribute from the escrow account (a) to Brand Purchaser a cash amount equal to the deficit (such deficit not to exceed the amount in escrow), and (b) to Gaiam any portion of the escrowed amount

remaining thereafter.    The consummation of the Brand Business Sale is subject to the satisfaction of various closing conditions before 90 days following

execution of the Brand Purchase Agreement, subject to extension (the Outside Date), including, without limitation, (a) expiration or termination of all applicable waiting periods (and all extensions thereof) under antitrust laws,

(b) obtaining material government approvals, (c) absence of any injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Brand Business Sale, (d) approval of the Brand Business Sale by Gaiams shareholders, which approval has been obtained

as described below, (e) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of each party, (f) performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Brand Purchase Agreement,

(g) the absence of a material adverse effect (as defined in the Brand Purchase Agreement), (h) either the consummation of the sale of the portion of the Brand Business Sale subject to the FFL Purchase Agreement or the transfer

and assignment of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities described in the FFL Purchase Agreement from the Brand Companies to Gaiam, and (i) receipt by each party of certain closing deliverables.

The Brand Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties that Gaiam and Brand Purchaser have made to each other. The sole recourse for

any damages with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties made by Gaiam in the Brand Purchase Agreement, subject to certain limited exceptions, will be a representation and warranty insurance policy in favor of Brand

Purchaser.    The Brand Purchase Agreement contains covenants customary for agreements of this nature, including, without limitation, covenants concerning

(a) the conduct of the Brand Business between the signing of the Brand Purchase Agreement and the closing of the Brand Business Sale, (b) non-competition and non-interference with clients, suppliers, licensees, and other business relations

of the Brand Business for two years following the closing of the Brand Business Sale, and (c) non-solicitation of employees for two years following the closing of the Brand Business Sale, subject to certain exceptions. Specifically, until the

closing of the Brand Business Sale, Gaiam is prohibited from taking certain actions that may result in an alternative transaction proposal other than the Brand Business Sale but may consider and enter into, subject to certain conditions, unsolicited

alternative transaction proposals Gaiams board of directors determines to be, or to be reasonably likely to result in, a superior proposal (as defined in the Brand Purchase Agreement). The Brand Purchase Agreement also contains

indemnities customary for agreements of this nature; however, subject to certain limited exceptions, there are no indemnities for breaches of Gaiams representations and warranties because such breaches are covered by a representation and

warranty insurance policy in favor of Brand Purchaser. Additionally, the sole recourse for any indemnification claims with respect to certain specified taxes will be the representation and warranty insurance policy.

The Brand Purchase Agreement contains certain termination rights. Either party may terminate the Brand Purchase

Agreement if (a) the Brand Business Sale has not occurred by the Outside Date, subject to extension upon mutual agreement between the parties, and subject to automatic extension for up to 30 days if any person successfully enjoins the Brand

Business Sale, and subject to further extensions for up to two additional 30 day periods in either partys option, or (b) a governmental entity issues a final judgment or takes other action effectively and permanently retraining, enjoining

or otherwise prohibiting the Brand Business Sale. Brand Purchaser may terminate the Brand Purchase Agreement if (i) Gaiam breaches or fails to perform its representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the Brand Purchase

Agreement, causing Brand Purchasers closing conditions to not be satisfied by the Outside Date, (ii) Gaiam materially breaches its obligations with respect to an alternative transaction proposal, or (iii) Gaiams board of

directors recommends that the shareholders not approve the Brand Business Sale, or approve an alternative transaction proposal. Gaiam may terminate the Brand Purchase Agreement if (A) Brand Purchaser breaches or fails to perform its

representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the Brand Purchase Agreement, causing Gaiams closing conditions to not be satisfied by the Outside Date, or (B) Gaiam approves a superior proposal and complies with certain

conditions, including paying Brand Purchaser the termination fee described below.    Gaiam must pay Brand Purchaser a one-time termination fee equal to

$5,010,000 if the Brand Purchase Agreement is terminated, subject to certain conditions, under certain circumstances generally involving (a) a material breach by Gaiam of its obligations under the Brand Purchase Agreement with respect to

alternative transaction proposals, (b) the Brand Business Sale not occurring by the Outside Date and Gaiam or Brand Purchaser not having the right to terminate the Brand Purchase Agreement as a result of a breach or failure by the other party

to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in the Brand Purchase Agreement and Gaiam entering into a definitive agreement with any third party to consummate, or consummates, an alternative transaction,

in some cases up to nine months after termination of the Brand Purchase Agreement, or (c) Gaiam approves and enters into an alternative transaction involving a superior proposal.

Pursuant to the Brand Purchase Agreement, promptly after the closing of the Brand Business Sale, Gaiam is required to cease operating under the name Gaiam,

Inc. and to change its name to Gaia, Inc.    Brand Purchaser Parent is a party to the Brand Purchase Agreement solely to guaranty Brand

Purchasers performance of its obligations under the Brand Purchase Agreement. Gaiam may recover directly from Brand Purchaser Parent without first having to seek to exhaust any remedy against Brand Purchaser.

On May 10, 2016, in connection with the execution of the Brand Purchase Agreement, one director, and an entity controlled by a director, in their

respective capacities as a shareholder, each beneficially owning more than 10% of Gaiams issued and outstanding common stock, entered into separate voting agreements with Gaiam, pursuant to which each such shareholder agreed (among other

things) to vote beneficially-owned shares of Gaiams common stock in favor of the Brand Business Sale and against any alternative transaction proposal (as defined in the voting agreement). Collectively, the shareholders party to the

voting agreements beneficially owned 2,926,710 shares of Gaiams Class A common stock and 5,400,000 shares of Gaiams Class B common stock, representing approximately 77.81% of the voting interest of Gaiams common stock, as of

April 28, 2016. On May 10, 2016, these shareholders executed a written consent approving the Brand Business Sale, the Brand Purchase Agreement, the FFL Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Brand Purchase Agreement

and the FFL Purchase Agreement.    Immediately before execution of the Brand Purchase Agreement, Gaiam and Brand Holdco entered into a Contribution

Agreement pursuant to which Gaiam contributed the assets of the Brand Business to Brand Holdco, including, but not limited to, all of Gaiams equity securities of Gaiam Americas, Inc. and Gaiam Americas, Inc.s subsidiaries.

Description of the FFL Purchase Agreement    Under the FFL

Purchase Agreement, FFL Purchaser agreed to pay Gaiam $21,300,000 in cash, subject to adjustments at closing and post-closing for working capital. FFL Purchaser will pay estimated net cash consideration to Gaiam at the closing equal to the

$21,300,000 purchase price, minus the Brand Companies working capital target amount, and plus the estimated working capital amount (which working capital estimate may not exceed the working capital target plus $5,000,000). After the closing,

the parties will calculate the final net cash consideration, using the calculation for estimated net cash consideration described above, based on the actual closing amounts of the Brand Companies working capital. If the final net cash

consideration is greater than the estimated net cash consideration paid at the closing, FFL Purchaser shall pay a cash amount equal to the excess to Gaiam within three business days of such determination. If the final net cash consideration is less

than the estimated net cash consideration paid at the closing, Gaiam and Brand Purchaser shall deliver

a joint instruction to the escrow agent to distribute from the escrow account established under the Brand Purchase Agreement to FFL Purchaser a cash amount equal to the deficit (such deficit not

to exceed the amount in escrow) to the extent the funds in the escrow account established under the Brand Purchase Agreement are not payable to Brand Purchaser under the terms of the Brand Purchase Agreement.

Either the consummation of the portion of the Brand Business Sale subject to the FFL Purchase Agreement or the transfer and assignment of the acquired assets

and assumed liabilities described in the FFL Purchase Agreement from the Brand Companies to Gaiam shall occur immediately before the consummation of the portion of the Brand Business Sale subject to the Brand Purchase Agreement and is subject to the

conditions that (a) Gaiam deliver a written notice to FFL Purchaser containing (i) a statement that the closing conditions under the Brand Purchase Agreement have been satisfied or waived and that Gaiam and Brand Purchase are ready and

prepared to close the portion of the Brand Business Sale contemplated by the Brand Purchase Agreement, subject only to the occurrence of the closing under the FFL Purchase Agreement, and (ii) the date on which the closing under the Brand

Purchase Agreement is to occur (which date will be at least three business days after the delivery of the written notice), and (b) receipt by each party of certain closing deliverables.

The FFL Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties that Gaiam and FFL Purchaser have made to each other. Gaiam is not making any

representations or warranties with respect to the assets to be sold by the Brand Companies pursuant to the FFL Purchase Agreement and such assets will be sold as-is and where is.

The FFL Purchase Agreement contains mutual covenants regarding non-competition and non-solicitation of employees for two years following the closing, and a

customary buyer-side financing covenant.    Either party may terminate the FFL Purchase Agreement if the Brand Purchase Agreement has been validly

terminated in accordance with its terms. Gaiam may terminate the FFL Purchase Agreement if FFL Purchaser does not pay the purchase price at closing.",FALSE

uniform light distribution over plants, with minimal light distribution outside the desired target area, compared to conventional

reflectors. We believe that by incorporating this new technology at a commercial scale we will be able to increase production and

ensure uniform growth rates and consistent quality plants while conserving valuable natural resources for indoor gardens. This

Surna-owned provisional patent was developed by our recently acquired subsidiary, Safari Resource Group, Inc.

We issued a press release

regarding the filing of this provisional patent application on May 8, 2014. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1

On October 31, 2008, the company commenced an action in New York State Supreme Court, County of New York, Commercial Division against Ice Engineering, LLC seeking the total balance owed by Ice Engineering to the company pursuant to an agreement entered into by the parties, effective June 15, 2007, namely, $2,700,000. Under the agreement, in connection with Torvec's assignment of the ice technology license to Ice Engineering, that company agreed to reimburse Torvec for approximately $3,500,000 Torvec previously had expended acquiring and maintaining the license. Ice Engineering has paid approximately $800,000 but is in arrears with respect to installments due June 1, 2008 and September 1, 2008 and apparently has repudiated its remaining payment obligations under the agreement. Ice Engineering, LLC was formed by Dr. Victor Petrenko, its President and Chief Scientist, in cooperation with Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, in order to take advantage of three field-of-use licenses granted by

Dartmouth College.  Ice Engineering has developed technology that affects the adhesion of ice to surfaces such as automobile glass, refrigeration units, and power lines in its laboratory facilities located on the Dartmouth College campus.  Dr. Petrenko has long been acknowledged as a leading expert in ice physics and is Director of Dartmouth's Ice Physics and Technology Laboratory at the Thayer School of Engineering. Torvec believes its claims are justified: Ice Engineering in cooperation with Dartmouth College has publicly stated that they believe the market for the ice technology is in the billions of dollars.  Torvec simply seeks reimbursement for a portion of the amounts it expended to assist in the development of the technology as the parties agreed to by contract.

On October 6, 2014, GT Advanced Technologies, Inc.

GTAT's bankruptcy filing causes an automatic stay in any arbitration proceedings in which GTAT is involved, including the arbitration proceeding with Ranor, Inc., a subsidiary of TechPrecision Corporation (the "" Company "") previously described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 and the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2014, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 15, 2014 and August 18, 2014, respectively (the "" Ranor Arbitration "").  The automatic stay results in the American Arbitration Association suspending administration of the Ranor Arbitration and the Company's claim in the Ranor Arbitration (the "" Ranor Claim "") is now considered an unsecured creditor claim within GTAT's overall bankruptcy proceedings.

While any payments to the Company as a result of the Ranor Claim were not certain prior to the GTAT bankruptcy, as a result of the GTAT bankruptcy, the timing of any determination in the Ranor Arbitration is uncertain and there is a significant risk that even if the Ranor Arbitration is settled or decided in favor of the Company, GTAT will not have the ability to make any award payments to the Company.  In light of such uncertainty, the Company is continuing to explore various financing alternatives to enhance the Company's financial position and ensure the Company's continued liquidity.

Cautionary Statement about the Monthly Operating Report

The Company cautions investors and potential investors not to place undue reliance upon the information contained in the Monthly Operating Report, which was not prepared for the purpose of providing the basis for an

investment decision relating to any of the securities of the Company. The Monthly Operating Report is limited in scope, covers a limited time period and has been prepared solely for the purpose of complying with the monthly reporting requirements of

the Bankruptcy Court. The Monthly Operating Report was not audited or reviewed by independent accountants, was not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, is in a format prescribed by applicable

bankruptcy laws or rules, and is subject to future adjustment and reconciliation. There can be no assurance that, from the perspective of an investor or potential investor in the Company's securities, the Monthly Operating Report is complete. Results

set forth in the Monthly Operating Report should not be viewed as indicative of future results.

Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements

Various statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including those that express a belief, expectation or intention, as well as those that are not statements of historical fact, are forward-looking

statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these

forward-looking statements as a result of certain risks and other factors, which include the following: risks and uncertainties relating to the Chapter 11 Cases, including but not limited to, the Company's ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval

with respect to motions in the Chapter 11 Cases, the effects of the Chapter 11 Cases on the Company and on the interests of various constituents, Bankruptcy Court rulings in the Chapter 11 Cases and the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases in general, the

duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, risks associated with third-party motions in the Chapter 11 Cases, and the Company's ability to realize proceeds from remaining assets; risks related to the trading of the Company's common stock on the OTC Pink

Market, particularly because the proposed plan of liquidation provides that there will not be sufficient funds or other assets to allow holders of the Company's common stock to receive any distribution of value in respect of their equity interests;

risks relating to the Company's ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court confirmation of the proposed plan of liquidation as proposed by the Company; the uncertainty as to when or whether the effective date of the proposed plan of liquidation will occur as

currently expected by the Company; and the risk that the Chapter 11 Cases may be converted to cases under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Company therefore cautions readers against relying on these forward-looking statements. All

senior unsecured bridge loan facility (the Bridge Loan Facility) with Goldman

Sachs Credit Partners L.P., Lehman Brothers Inc. and other lenders. On October

1, 2007, no borrowings were outstanding under the Bridge Loan Facility, and no

borrowings are expected to be made under the Bridge Loan Facility until a time

that is substantially concurrent with the effectiveness of the merger and

reclassification transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated

as of July 21, 2007 among Transocean, GlobalSantaFe Corporation and Transocean

Worldwide Inc. (the Agreement and Plan of Merger).

Transocean may make

borrowings under the Bridge Loan Facility at either (1) a base rate, determined

as the greater of (A) the prime loan rate quoted in  The Wall

Street Journal  Money Rates Section as the prime rate or (B) the federal

funds effective rate plus  1/2 of 1%, or (2) the reserve adjusted LIBO rate plus

the applicable margin, which is based upon Transoceans non-credit enhanced

senior unsecured long-term debt rating (a margin of 0.4%, based on its current

credit ratings).

The Bridge Loan Facility

may be prepaid in whole or in part without premium or penalty. In addition, the

Bridge Loan Facility requires mandatory prepayments of outstanding borrowings

in an amount equal to 100 percent of the net cash proceeds resulting from any

of the following (in each case subject to certain agreed exceptions): (A) the

sale or other disposition of any property or assets of Transocean or its

subsidiaries above a predetermined threshold; (B) the receipt of certain net

insurance or condemnation proceeds; (C) certain issuances of equity securities

of Transocean or its subsidiaries; and (D) the incurrence of indebtedness for

borrowed money by Transocean or its subsidiaries.

The Bridge Loan Facility

contains certain covenants that are applicable during the period in which any

borrowings are outstanding, including a maximum leverage ratio and covenants

restricting Transoceans ability to pay dividends. Borrowings under the Bridge

Loan Facility are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of

default.

The obligation of each

lender to make loans under the Bridge Loan Facility is subject to the

satisfaction of certain conditions, including the execution of satisfactory

documentation, the absence of a material adverse effect (as defined in the

Agreement and Plan of Merger) and the consummation, or substantially concurrent

consummation, of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of

Merger. There can be no assurance that these conditions will be met.

Transocean will likely

seek to refinance the Bridge Loan Facility in whole or in part prior to the

expiration of its one-year term. Such refinancing may be effected through

borrowings under new bank credit facilities, issuance of debt securities,

including convertible debt securities, or through other financing transactions.

Amendments to Costa Brava Debt Instruments

On September 6, 2012, Spy Optic entered into (a) an amendment to the Third Amended and Restated $10 million Promissory Note dated August 2, 2012 and originally issued to Costa Brava on June 21, 2011 (the "" Costa Brava Line of Credit Note "") and (b) an amendment to the Second Amended and Restated $7 million Promissory Note dated August 2, 2012 and originally issued to Costa Brava on December 20, 2010 (the "" Costa Brava Term Note "").

The Costa Brava Line of Credit Note, as amended, provides that Spy Optic is obligated to repay up to $4 million of its indebtedness under the Costa Brava Line of Credit Note, at the election of Costa Brava, in the event that SPY or its subsidiaries complete certain debt or equity financings (including the Harlingwood Financing) in an aggregate amount of $4 million or more between September 6, 2012 and December 31, 2012. Any amount so repaid will reduce dollar-for-dollar Costa Brava's commitment to make advances under the Costa Brava Line of Credit Note.

The amendments to the Costa Brava Term Note and the Costa Brava Line of Credit Note that the paid in kind interest that accrues monthly under such promissory notes may not be paid in cash until the promissory notes mature on April 1, 2014. Spy Optic has previously elected to pay all interest in kind under both promissory notes since January 1, 2012.

SPY and Costa Brava also entered into a registration rights agreement dated September 6, 2012 pursuant to which SPY is required to provide notice to Costa Brava of certain proposed public offerings of SPY's common stock and, if Costa Brava so requests, register the shares of common stock into which the Costa Brava Term Note may be converted, subject to certain conditions and limitations described in the registration rights agreement.

Costa Brava beneficially owns approximately 48.5%, or 49.8% on an as converted basis, of SPY's common stock as of September 6, 2012. Mr. Seth Hamot, Chairman of our Board of Directors of SPY, is the President and sole member of the sole general partner of Costa Brava.

Harlingwood Debt Financing

SPY and Spy Optic entered into a convertible note purchase agreement on September 6, 2012 with Harlingwood pursuant to which Spy Optic issued a promissory note to Harlingwood in the principal amount of $1 million (the "" Harlingwood Note "") and SPY and Harlingwood entered into a registration rights agreement, described below. The convertible note purchase agreement included representations and warranties by each of the SPY, Spy Optic and Harlingwood that are customary for an agreement for the sale of such securities.

The Harlingwood Note accrues interest at the rate of 12% per annum, which is payable in kind as an addition to the outstanding principal amount due under the Harlingwood Note on the last day of each calendar month in arrears. The Harlingwood Note matures on April 1, 2014. The principal amount due under the Harlingwood Note (including any capitalized interest) is convertible into common stock of SPY at $1.40 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment for stock splits or stock dividends. Spy Optic agreed to pay an initial facility fee to Harlingwood of $10,000 by September 17, 2012 and future facility fees on each anniversary of the Harlingwood Note until the Harlingwood Note matures equal to the lesser of $10,000 or 1% of the average daily outstanding principal amount due under the Harlingwood Note (without giving effect to any capitalized interest).

In the event of default, the Harlingwood Note will accrue interest at 14% during the pendency of such event of default and Harlingwood may declare the outstanding amounts then due under the Harlingwood Note immediately due and payable. In addition, Harlingwood may declare the outstanding amounts then due under the Harlingwood Note immediately due and payable in the event that Costa Brava declares the amounts due under either the Costa Brava Term Note or Costa Brava Line of Credit Note immediately due and payable. For purposes of the Harlingwood Note, an event of default includes certain events that are customary for financings of this type, including the failure to pay any amounts due under the promissory note when due, the failure to observe covenants and obligations under the promissory note, the assignment for benefit of creditors or the institution of bankruptcy proceedings.

SPY and Harlingwood also entered into a registration rights agreement dated September 6, 2012 pursuant to which SPY is required to provide notice to Harlingwood of certain proposed public offerings of SPY's common stock and, if Harlingwood so requests, register the shares of common stock into which the Harlingwood Note may be converted, subject to certain conditions and limitations described in the registration rights agreement.

On September 8, 2009, Constitution Mining Corp. (the ""Company"") reported drill results from its first hole drilled on properties referred to as the Peruvian Gold Sands project located in Peru.  The Company currently has a twenty-five percent ownership interest in the mineral rights described in Annex 1 of the

Mineral Right Option Agreement (the ""Mineral Rights"") underlying the property in Peru on which the Peruvian Gold Sands project is located, with an option to potentially acquire one hundred percent of the Mineral Rights.  The first hole drilled intersected a layer of mineralization with 424 mg/m3 of gold, a grade that is significantly higher than drill results of 295mg/m3 of gold reported between 1990 and 1992 in the same area by a private Peruvian company, Monica de Iquitos.

While the drill results the Company received from the initial drill hole were favorable, the Company cautions that such results do not in any way indicate the presence of a commercially viable mineral deposit.  There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on the properties underlying our mineral property

interests in Peru and a great deal of further exploration is required before a final evaluation as to the economic and legal feasibility of future exploration is determined.  The Company has developed an extensive plan of exploration with the principal objective of determining whether minerals that exists on the property are of sufficient quantity to support commercial production.  The Company has commenced its planned exploration program, but must secure additional financing in the near

future in order to be able to sustain any drilling activity or it will be forced to cease its exploration and development program.

2018 Revolving Credit Facility ranging from 0.250% to 0.375% per annum and determined based on average utilization of the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility (increasing when utilization is low and decreasing when utilization is high). The ABL Borrowers

will also be required to pay customary letter of credit fees.    The 2018 Revolving Credit Facility also requires that if specified excess

availability is less than the greater of 10% of the line cap (as defined in the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility) and $25.0 million, until such time as such specified excess availability is greater than or equal to the greater of 10% of the line

The third bullet point under the subsection "" Engility Discounted Cash Flow Analyses""

*

In estimating Engility's terminal/continuing value, Guggenheim Securities used a reference range of perpetual growth rates of Engility's terminal year normalized after-tax

unlevered free cash flow of 2.00% - 3.00%. The terminal/continuing values implied by the foregoing perpetual growth rate reference range were cross-checked for reasonableness by reference to Engility's implied terminal year EBITDA

multiples ,  which ranged from 8.7x to 12.1x .

b)

The last paragraph on page 80 of the Proxy Statement under the subsection "" Engility

Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis""  is hereby amended as follows:

Guggenheim Securities' selected publicly traded companies analysis resulted in an overall reference range of (i) $26.45

- $48.36 per share excluding the estimated present value of Engility's existing tax benefits  ($27.84-$48.36 per share based on CY2018E EBITDA and $26.45 - $42.69

per share based on CY2019E EBITDA)   and (ii) $31.90 - $54.07 per share including the estimated present value of Engility's existing tax benefits

($33.29 to $54.07 per share based on CY2018E EBITDA and $31.90 - $48.40 per share based on CY2019E EBITDA)   for purposes of evaluating Engility's common stock on a stand-alone public market trading basis.

c)

The third bullet under the subsection "" SAIC Discounted Cash Flow Analyses""  is

hereby amended as follows:

*

In estimating SAIC's terminal/continuing value, Guggenheim Securities used a reference range of perpetual growth rates of SAIC's terminal year normalized after-tax

unlevered free cash flow of 2.00% - 3.00%. The terminal/continuing values implied by the foregoing perpetual growth rate reference range were cross-checked for reasonableness by reference to SAIC's implied terminal year EBITDA multiples ,  which ranged from 9.3x to 13.8x .

The last paragraph under the subsection "" SAIC Selected Publicly Traded Companies

Analysis""  is hereby amended as follows:

e)

The first paragraph under the subsection "" Other Financial Reviews and Analyses ""

is hereby amended as follows:

Engility Illustrative Has/Gets

Analysis (Based on Market Approach) . Guggenheim Securities analyzed the pro forma impact of the transaction on the SAIC stock price and the implied Engility attributable per share equity value assuming that the value of the combined

company would be equal to (i) SAIC's then-current enterprise value, plus (ii) Engility's then-current enterprise value, plus (iii) the capitalized value of synergies assuming a 9.0x capitalization multiple, less (iv) typical adjustments from

enterprise value to equity value including debt, cash, minority interest and the PV of tax benefits (including NOLs).  The assumed value of the combined company,

excluding the capitalized value of synergies, implied a weighted-average, tax-adjusted trading enterprise value / CY2019E EBITDA multiple (based on weighted-average EBITDA contribution) of 13.4x .

Under those assumptions, the implied Engility attributable equity value would be $43.55 per share as compared to the then-current price of

$36.24. Guggenheim Securities noted that assuming a synergies capitalization multiple equal to the then-current weighted average trading enterprise value / CY2019E EBITDA multiple ( based

on weighted-average EBITDA contribution   or 13.4x ) resulted in an implied Engility attributable equity value of $45.95 per share as

compared to the then-current price of $36.24.

f)

The third paragraph under the subsection "" Other Considerations "" on page 84 is

hereby amended as follows:

Aside from its current engagement by Engility, Guggenheim Securities has not been previously engaged during the past two years by Engility,

nor has Guggenheim Securities been previously engaged during the past two years by SAIC, to provide financial advisory, capital markets,  or other  investment

banking  or other  services for which Guggenheim Securities received fees. Guggenheim Securities may seek to provide Engility and SAIC and their

respective affiliates with certain financial advisory and investment banking services unrelated to the merger in the future, for which services Guggenheim Securities would expect to receive compensation.

conditions, competitive environment, as well as actual performance throughout the year . Engility management also made adjustments to the assumed margin profile of certain opportunities being competed (re-compete and new business).

Agreement). The aggregate initial commitments of the lenders under the Credit Agreement are

$350,000,000 and are expandable to a maximum of $450,000,000. The Credit Agreement matures on

October 29, 2012 and bears interest at the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate or LIBOR, plus

applicable margins ranging from 2.375% to 3.250%, or an alternate base rate, based upon (i) the

greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, and LIBOR plus 0.5% plus (ii)

applicable margins ranging from 1.375% to 2.250%.

or substantially all of the Partnerships assets, make certain transfers, enter into certain

affiliate transactions, make distributions or other payments other than distributions of available

Santander Holdings USA, Inc. - Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (""DFAST"") Disclosure

This disclosure of summary stress test results is required by 12 CFR 252.148, which implements the requirements of Section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The following results reflect  pro forma  capital ratios and select Income Statement line items for Santander Holdings USA, Inc. (""SHUSA"") and its insured depository subsidiary, Santander Bank, N.A. (""SBNA""), under the Federal Reserve Board's (""Federal Reserve's"") Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario.

Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing Assumptions

Stress Scenario

The Federal Reserve's Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario was released by the Federal Reserve on November 1, 2013.  This scenario is characterized by a substantial weakening in economic activity.  In addition, the scenario features a significant reversal of recent improvements to the U.S. housing market and the euro area outlook. In summary, for the United States:

The unemployment rate increases 4 percentage points from current levels and peaks at 11 1/4 percent in the middle of 2015,

Real GDP declines nearly 4 3/4 percent between the third quarter of 2013 and the end of 2014. A slow recovery takes hold in 2015, and real GDP expands 2 percent in 2015 and nearly 4 percent in 2016,

House prices decline 25 percent during the scenario period, while commercial real estate prices decline nearly 35 percent at their trough,

Short-term interest rates remain near zero through 2016. The yield on the long-term Treasury bond declines to 1 percent in 2014 before edging up approximately 1 percentage point by the end of 2016

It is important to note that this scenario is not a forecast of anticipated economic conditions, but rather a hypothetical scenario designed by the Federal Reserve to help assess the strength and resilience of financial institutions to a severely adverse economic environment.

SHUSA considers identified material risks in its stress testing activities. In addition to broad industry-wide risks, SHUSA considers a wide range of key risks facing the company, including the following:

Credit risk, mostly from real estate related portfolios and large corporates,

Revenue at risk (i.e. strategic risk) from growth plans of specific business units,

Operational risk, or the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events,

Compliance risk, mostly found in the retail banking sector,

Market risk, or the risk to SHUSA's financial condition from changes in interest rates or changes in the market value of assets and traded financial instruments, both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet; and

Liquidity risk, or the risk arising from an inability to meet obligations as they come due in the normal course of business without undue hardship or incurring unacceptable loss.

Description of Methodologies Employed

SHUSA employs various methodologies in its stress tests for balance sheet, income statement, and capital projections.  In general, SHUSA utilizes various modeling techniques in developing its stress test estimates including regression-based modeling, business analytics, or other objective, quantitative forecasting methodologies.  SHUSA also incorporates expert management judgment in the analysis of the stress test estimates.

The following describes the methodologies used in the SHUSA stress testing process:

Loss Estimation:  For the purposes of capital planning and loss forecasting, SHUSA has developed loss forecasting models linked to macroeconomic variables across its commercial and retail portfolios. SHUSA has also developed models for the estimation of operational risk.

Revenues and Expenses : Pre-provision net revenue (""PPNR""), through retained earnings, is a major source of capital for SHUSA and is a crucial driver of stress test results. SHUSA's PPNR forecasting methodology consists of several models used in conjunction to forecast line items for the balance sheet and income statement.  The balance sheet and non-interest income and expense are forecasted by OLS regression on macroeconomic factors.  Net interest income is forecast based on interest rates projected and applied to the modeled loan and deposit balances within the asset liability management tool.  These results are subject to management review and adjustment.

Provision for Loan and Lease Loses:  The credit loss stress tests models create estimations for expected reserve levels (both ALLL and contingent) and related provision expenses that SHUSA will incur under each of the macroeconomic scenarios. SHUSA's reserve level is determined on an expectation of the future net charge offs and built up to absorb those credit losses.  Provision expense is taken at each forecast period to adjust the reserve levels up or down to the necessary levels.

Changes in capital position over the planning horizon:   The methodologies described above translate identified risks into potential revenue and loss projections over the 9-quarter planning horizon. These projections are then aggregated into net income / loss estimates over the planning horizon. These estimates then feed SHUSA's regulatory capital estimation process. These regulatory capital calculations are based on existing regulatory guidance as well as proposed guidance when applicable. SHUSA also estimates impacts to regulatory capital based on planned capital actions or prescribed actions. These capital ratios then become a key input into SHUSA's capital adequacy assessment.

Explanation of the most significant causes for the changes in regulatory capital ratios and Tier 1 common ratio

A factor in the projected decline of SHUSA's capital ratios is the expectation of credit costs exceeding pre-provision net revenues over the 9-quarter forecast horizon. As detailed in the estimated results tables, this leads to a net loss of approximately $1.1 billion before taxes over the forecast horizon for SHUSA.  Partially offsetting this impact is the projection for a decrease in risk-weighted assets reflecting the severely adverse economic environment.

An additional factor for the change in SHUSA's regulatory capital ratios and Tier 1 common ratio under SHUSA's capital plan was the pro forma consolidation of Santander Consumer USA Inc. (""SCUSA"") into SHUSA in Q1 2014.  As of September 30, 2013 SCUSA was reflected on SHUSA's balance sheet as a $2.9 billion equity investment.  The impact of the pro forma consolidation can be seen in the table below, which compares SHUSA's projected Q1:14 capital ratios to Q3:13 actual ratios.

The consolidation of SCUSA into SHUSA is estimated to impact SHUSA's capital ratios in two ways.  First, the consolidation leads to the addition of $24.5 billion in risk weighted assets to SHUSA's balance sheet ($27.3 billion in total assets).  Second, the recognition of a substantial minority interest ($1.0 billion net of associated goodwill) that is deducted from Tier 1 common and Common equity Tier 1.

Finally, another factor in the projected decline of SHUSA's capital ratios is the implementation of the standardized risk-weighted asset rules effective January 2015.

Santander Bank, NA (""SBNA"")

The following results reflect  pro forma  capital ratios for SBNA under the Federal Reserve's Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario. These capital levels are derived using a process identical to that described in this document for SHUSA.  SBNA's capital ratios decline over the 9-quarter planning horizon in this theoretical severely adverse scenario as credit costs exceed pre-provision net revenue generation.  The consolidation of SCUSA into SHUSA does not impact SBNA's capital ratios.

SBNA Capital Actions

These summary stress test results for SBNA include the following capital action assumptions:

1)

Payment of quarterly distributions on common stock from SBNA to SHUSA in accordance with SBNA's capital adequacy analysis and internal capital policy,

2)

Scheduled interest payments on existing subordinated debt securities, and

3)

No redemption or repurchase of any capital instrument that is eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio.

Estimates under Federal Reserve Severely Adverse Scenario

SBNA's DFAST capital ratios under the Federal Reserve Severely Adverse scenario remain well above the regulatory requirement of a minimum Tier 1 common ratio of 5% and a minimum Common equity tier 1 ratio of 4.5%.

Explanation of the most significant causes for the changes in regulatory capital ratios and tier 1 common ratio

The Federal Reserve's Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario, as applied internally through SHUSA's capital planning process, results in projected declines in SBNA's regulatory capital ratios of approximately 200 basis points from 3Q 2013 actual levels.  This decline is primarily driven by an expectation of credit costs exceeding pre-provision net revenues over the 9-quarter forecast horizon. As detailed in the estimated results tables, this leads to a net loss of approximately $1.8 billion before taxes over the forecast horizon for SBNA.  Partially offsetting this impact is the projection for a decrease in risk-weighted assets reflecting the severely adverse economic environment.

The options to purchase shares of AB stock granted to our executive officers have an exercise price of $21.475 per share, which was the fair market value of AB stock on the grant date based on the average of the high and low sales price of AB stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the grant date, and the options to purchase shares of CRA stock granted to our executive officers have an exercise price of $10.155 per share, which was the fair market value of CRA stock on the grant date based on the average of the high and low sales price of CRA stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the grant date.  These options have a term of 10 years from the grant date, and are fully vested and exercisable as of the grant date.

However, shares acquired upon the exercise of these options are subject to a restriction on transfer (covering sales, gifts, pledges, and any other method of disposition).  The transfer restriction will lapse, for each grant of options to purchase AB stock and CRA stock, on 25% of the shares covered by these grants on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date.  Also, the transfer restriction will lapse in full upon termination of employment for any reason.

Acceleration

of Vesting of Previously Awarded Stock Options.   At the June 2, 2005,

MRC meeting, the MRC approved acceleration of the vesting of unvested stock

options previously awarded to some Applera employees, including some executive

officers. The accelerated options were issued under the Applera Corporation/Applied

Biosystems Group Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Incentive Plan and the

Applera Corporation/Celera Genomics Group Amended and Restated 1999 Stock

Incentive Plan, and were issued in conjunction with long term

incentives awarded to those Applera employees under the Applera

Corporation Performance Unit Bonus Plan. However, shares acquired upon

the exercise

of these options are subject to a restriction on transfer (covering sales,

gifts, pledges, and any other method of disposition). The transfer restriction

will lapse as to shares issuable upon the exercise of these options on

Stock Purchase Agreement    On April 5,

2014, The Laclede Group, Inc. (Laclede), entered into a definitive agreement to acquire from Energen Corporation (Energen) all of the outstanding shares of stock (the Transaction) of Alabama Gas Corporation

(Alagasco). The acquisition will be effected pursuant to a stock purchase agreement among Laclede, Energen and Alagasco (the Acquisition Agreement). The consideration for the Transaction is $1.6 billion, including the

assumption of approximately $250 million of long-term debt. Laclede has agreed to make an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to treat the Transaction as a deemed purchase and sale of assets for

tax purposes. The consideration will be subject to a customary post-closing adjustment for cash, indebtedness and working capital. Following completion of the Transaction, Alagasco will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Laclede.

Representations, Warranties and Covenants

The Acquisition Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants of Alagasco, Energen and Laclede. During the executory

period, Alagasco will operate the business in the ordinary course until the Transaction is consummated, with specific limitations on dividends, entry into material contracts and employee benefits, among others. Energen and Alagasco have also agreed

to cooperate with Lacledes efforts to obtain permanent financing. The Transaction is not subject to any financing condition. See Financing Commitment below.

Upon the closing (and subject thereto), Laclede will repay Alagascos outstanding indebtedness under its existing credit facility and

will make, or cause Alagasco to make, a customary change-of-control offer to prepay certain outstanding privately-held notes of Alagasco.

The parties have agreed to indemnify each other for breaches of representations, warranties and covenants, as well as losses resulting from

assets or liabilities assumed or retained by each party, as applicable. Generally, Energens aggregate liability with respect to such indemnification obligations in the Acquisition Agreement, after a $15 million deductible, is capped at $25

million, however, certain fundamental representations and certain covenants are not subject to such limitations.    Conditions to Closing

Consummation of the Transaction is subject to customary conditions, including, without limitation: (i) the expiration or early termination

of the waiting period applicable to the Transaction under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and any required approvals thereunder, (ii) the receipt of required approvals from the Alabama Public Service

Commission, as applicable, and (iii) the absence of any law, injunction, judgment or ruling prohibiting or restraining the Transaction. In addition, it is a condition to Energens obligations to close the Transaction that it amend or

refinance its outstanding credit facilities on terms which are reasonably acceptable to Energen so as to not cause the obligations thereunder to be in default upon the closing of the Transactions.

Termination    The Acquisition Agreement

contains certain termination rights for both Laclede and Energen, including, among others, the right to terminate if the Transaction is not completed by May 1, 2015 (subject to extension to August 3, 2015, under certain circumstances

related to fulfillment of regulatory closing conditions).

The Acquisition Agreement is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by

reference. The foregoing description of the Acquisition Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Acquisition Agreement.

The Acquisition Agreement has been included to provide security holders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide

factual information about Laclede, Energen or Alagasco and should not be relied on by any other person or entity for any purposes. The Acquisition Agreement contains representations and warranties that each of the parties have made to each other as

of specific dates and to evidence their agreement on various issues. The assertions and other statements or disclosures embodied in those representations and warranties were made solely for purposes of the contract between such parties and may be

subject to important qualifications and limitations or other factors agreed to by each such party in connection with the negotiated terms, which qualifications and limitations are not necessarily reflected in the Acquisition Agreement. Moreover,

some of those representations and warranties may not be accurate or complete as of any specified date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to investors or may have been used for purposes

of allocating risk between each party rather than establishing matters as fact. Based on the foregoing, you should not rely on the representations, warranties and disclosures included in the Acquisition Agreement as statements of factual

information.    Financing Commitment

On April 5, 2014, Laclede entered into a commitment letter (the Commitment Letter) with Credit Suisse AG, and its affiliates

(collectively Credit Suisse) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and its affiliates (collectively Wells Fargo together with Credit Suisse, the Banks). Pursuant to the Commitment Letter, the Banks have

committed to provide a 364-day senior bridge term loan credit facility (the Bridge Term Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of $1.35 billion to fund the Transaction. The commitment is subject to various conditions, including,

(i) the absence of a material adverse effect having occurred with respect to either Laclede (on a combined basis with Alagasco) or Alagasco, (ii) no default created under any material contractual obligation or creation or imposition of any

security interest or lien, in each case, related to Lacledes entering into and performance of the Bridge Term Facility, (iii) the execution of satisfactory definitive documentation and (iv) other customary closing conditions. Any

permanent debt and equity financing obtained by Laclede on or prior to the closing of the Transaction will reduce the amount of the commitment under the Commitment Letter.

Term Loan Agreement

the Contribution Agreement (the Contribution Agreement), dated November 11, 2008, among Western

Gas Resources, Inc. (WGR), WGR Asset Holding Company LLC, WGR Holdings, LLC (WGR Holdings),

Western Gas Holdings, LLC (the General Partner), Western Gas Partners, LP (the Partnership),

Western Gas Operating, LLC (Western Gas Operating) and WGR Operating, LP, the Partnership entered

into a Term Loan Agreement (the Term Loan Agreement) with Anadarko Petroleum Corporation

(Anadarko) under which Anadarko loaned $175,000,000 to the Partnership to fund a portion of the

Partnerships acquisition of certain assets pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, as described

further under Item 2.01 below. The borrowing under the Term Loan Agreement has a maturity of five

years and will bear interest at a rate of 4% through the period ending on December 1, 2010.

Following that date, interest will be assessed at a floating rate, equivalent to the LIBO Rate

(defined in the Term Loan Agreement) plus 150 basis points. The Partnership has the option to

repay the loan (plus accrued and unpaid interest) in whole or in part commencing upon the second

anniversary of the date of the Term Loan Agreement. The terms of the Term Loan Agreement provide

that amounts due are non-recourse to the General Partner and limited partners of the Partnership.

The Term Loan Agreement contains customary events of default, including (i) nonpayment of principal

when due or nonpayment of interest or other amounts within three business days of when due; (ii)

bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Partnership; or (iii) a change of control. All

amounts due by the Partnership under the Term Loan Agreement are unconditionally and irrevocably

guaranteed by WGR. All of the parties to the Contribution Agreement and the Term Loan Agreement

The

following information is being provided solely to comply with

Regulation FD

because Charter Communications, Inc. (""Charter""),  the

indirect parent company and manager of CCH II, LLC and CCH II

Capital Corp.,

through its subsidiary Charter Communications Operating,

LLC, expects to

be providing this information to certain potential investors

as part of a

refinancing of its credit facility in the near future.

Because

the first quarter has only recently ended, the information that

follows is, by

necessity, preliminary in nature and based only upon preliminary

information

available to Charter as of the date of this report. Investors

should exercise

caution in relying on the information contained herein and should

not draw any

inferences from this information regarding financial or operating

data that is

not discussed herein.

In

the

first quarter of 2006, Charter continued its targeted marketing

efforts and

related expenditures that began in the third quarter of 2005.

The long-term

objective of these efforts is to increase its revenues through

deeper market

penetration of all of its services. We believe these efforts

have been effective

as reflected in the following customer results. In addition,

in January 2006, we

completed the acquisition of certain cable systems in Minnesota

from Seren

Innovations, Inc. (""Seren"").

*

first

quarter 2006 net gains of analog video customers are

approximately 29,400

(including approximately 17,500 customers acquired

in the Seren

acquisition) compared to a net loss of approximately

6,700 in the first

quarter of 2005;

*

first

quarter 2006 net gains of digital video customers are

approximately 70,100

(including approximately 8,000 customers acquired in

the Seren

acquisition) compared to a net gain of approximately

19,900 in the first

quarter of 2005;

*

first

quarter 2006 net gains of high-speed Internet customers

are approximately

126,000 (including approximately 13,200 customers acquired

in the Seren

acquisition) compared to a net gain of approximately

94,000 in the first

quarter of 2005; and

*

first

quarter 2006 net gains of telephone customers are approximately

69,600

(including approximately 14,500 customers acquired

in the Seren

acquisition) compared to a net gain of approximately

9,900 in the first

quarter of 2005.

Charter

currently expects actual revenue for the first quarter 2006 of

between $1.365

billion and $1.380 billion, which would represent an increase

of approximately

7.5% to 8.5% compared to the same period in 2005.   Charter currently

expects actual adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter 2006 to

be essentially flat

versus the same period in the prior year. The Company expects

that operating

expenses increased in the first quarter of 2006 over the first

quarter of 2005,

due in large part to increased programming expense as a result

of annual rate

increases, as well as higher costs associated with improved customer

service

levels and the increases in customers noted above. Adjusted EBITDA

is a non-GAAP

term; see the ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Metrics"" section below

for a definition

of this term and additional information.

Capital

expenditures for the first quarter of 2006 are currently expected

to be between

$235 million and $260 million, which would be higher than capital

expenditures

of $211 million during the same quarter in the prior year, but

less than fourth

quarter 2005 capital expenditures of $273 million. Capital expenditures

for the

full year 2006 are expected to be approximately $1.0 billion

to $1.1

billion.

Information

regarding certain financial performance measures not discussed

herein, including

net cash flows from operating activities and EBITDA, is not

provided on the date

hereof because the first quarter has only recently ended and

reliable estimates

of certain items used in the calculations of such measures

are not yet

available.

Use

of Non-GAAP Financial Metrics

Charter

uses certain measures that are not defined by GAAP (Generally

Accepted

Accounting Principles) to evaluate various aspects of its business.

Adjusted

EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered

in addition to,

not as a substitute for, net cash flows from operating activities

reported

in

accordance

with GAAP. These terms as defined by Charter may not be comparable

to similarly

titled measures used by other companies.

Adjusted

EBITDA is defined as income from operations before special

charges, non-cash

depreciation and amortization, gain/loss on sale or retirement

of assets, asset

impairment charges and option compensation expense. As such,

it eliminates the

significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense

that results from the

capital-intensive nature of Charter's businesses and intangible assets

recognized in business combinations as well as other non-cash

or non-recurring

items, and is unaffected by Charter's capital structure or investment

activities. Adjusted EBITDA is a liquidity measure used by

Charter's management

and the Board of Directors to measure Charter's ability to fund operations and

its financing obligations. For this reason, it is a significant

component of

Charter's annual incentive compensation program. However, this measure

is

limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain

capitalized

tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues

and the cash cost of

financing. Charter's management evaluates these costs through other financial

measures.

Charter

believes that adjusted EBITDA provides information useful to

investors in

assessing Charter's ability to service its debt, fund operations, and make

additional investments with internally generated funds. In

addition, adjusted

EBITDA generally correlates to the leverage ratio calculation

under its credit

facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with

the covenants

contained in the facilities and notes (all such documents have

been previously

filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission).

Certain

Definitions Relating to Customer Statistics

Terms

used in this Item 7.01 shall have the following meanings:

""Customers""

include all persons our corporate billing records show as receiving

service

(regardless of their payment status), except for complimentary

accounts (such as

our employees). In addition, ''customers'' include persons

whose accounts were

over 60, 90 and 120 days past due in payment. We currently

believe that the

number of customers whose accounts were over 60 and 90 days

past due in payment

have decreased approximately 4% and 17%, respectively, from

the fourth quarter

of 2005, and that the number of customers whose accounts were

over 120 days past

due in payment have increased approximately 5% from the fourth

quarter of

2005.

""Analog

video customers'' include all customers who receive video services

(including

those who also purchase high-speed Internet and telephone services)

but exclude

customers who receive high-speed Internet service only or telephone

service only

and who are only counted as high-speed Internet customers or

telephone

customers.

Included

within video customers are those in commercial and multi-dwelling

structures,

which are calculated on an equivalent bulk unit (""EBU'') basis.

EBU is

calculated for a system by dividing the bulk price charged

to accounts in an

area by the most prevalent price charged to non-bulk residential

customers in

that market for the comparable tier of service. The EBU method

of estimating

analog video customers is consistent with the methodology used

in determining

costs paid to programmers and has been consistently applied

year over year. As

we increase our effective analog prices to residential customers

without a

corresponding increase in the prices charged to commercial

service or

multi-dwelling customers, our EBU count will decline even if

there is no real

loss in commercial service or multi-dwelling customers.

""Digital

video customers'' include all households that have one or more

digital set-top

terminals.

expenditures, either through cash flows from operating

activities, further

borrowings or other sources and, in particular, our

ability to be able to

provide under applicable debt instruments such funds

(by dividend,

investment or otherwise) to the applicable obligor

of such

debt;

*

our

ability to comply with all covenants in our indentures,

bridge loan and

credit facilities, any violation of which would result

in a violation of

the applicable facility or indenture and could trigger

a default of other

obligations under cross-default

provisions;

our

ability to pay or refinance debt prior to or when

it becomes due and/or to

take advantage of market opportunities and market

windows to refinance

that debt through new issuances, exchange offers

Amended and Restated Triple Net Hospital Building Lease
-------------------------------------------------------

As a condition of the New Credit Facilities, the Company entered into an Amended
and Restated Triple Net Hospital Building Lease with PCHI (the ""Amended Lease"").
The Amended Lease terminates on the 25-year anniversary of the original lease
(March 8, 2005) (and grants the Company the right to renew for one additional
25-year period) and requires annual base rental payments of $8,300,000 (but
until the Company refinances its $50,000,000 Revolving Line of Credit Loan with
a stated interest rate less than 14% per annum or PCHI refinances the Real
Estate Loan, the annual base rental payments are reduced to $7,100,000). In
addition, the Company may offset against its rental payments owed to PCHI
interest payments that it makes to MedCap under certain of its indebtedness
discussed above. The Amended Lease also gives PCHI sole possession of the
medical office buildings located at 1901/1905 North College Avenue, Santa Ana,
California (the ""Kindred Property"") that are unencumbered by any claims by or
tenancy of the Company.

Settlement Agreement
--------------------

Concurrently with the execution of the Amended Lease, the Company, PCHI,
Ganesha, and West Coast entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release
(the ""Settlement Agreement"") whereby the Company agreed to pay to PCHI
$2,500,000 as settlement for unpaid rents specified in the Settlement Agreement,
relating to the Kindred Property, and for compensation relating to the medical
office buildings located at 999 North Tustin Avenue in Santa Ana, California,

The information contained in Item 1.01 of this current report

on Form 8-K is responsive to this item. Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On February 1, 2017, The Alkaline Water Company Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) entered into a Credit and Security Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with SCM Specialty Finance Opportunities Fund, L.P. (the “Lender”).

The Credit Agreement provides the Company with a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”), the proceeds of which are to be used to repay existing indebtedness of the Company, transaction fees incurred in connection with the Credit Agreement and for working capital needs of the Company.

Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Lender has agreed to make cash advances to the Company in an aggregate principal at any one time outstanding not to exceed the lesser of (i) $3 million (the “Revolving Loan Commitment Amount”) and (ii) the Borrowing Base (defined to mean, as of any date of determination, 85% of net eligible billed receivables plus 65% of eligible unbilled receivables, minus certain reserves).

The Credit Agreement has a term of three years, unless earlier terminated by the parties in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.

The principal amount of the Revolving Facility outstanding bears interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) a fluctuating interest rate per annum equal at all times to the rate of interest announced, from time to time, within Wells Fargo Bank at its principal office in San Francisco as its “prime rate,” plus (ii) 3.25%, payable monthly in arrears.

To secure the payment and performance of the obligations under the Credit Agreement, the Company granted to the Lender a continuing security interest in all of the Company’s assets and agreed to a lockbox account arrangement in respect of certain eligible receivables.

In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company paid to the Lender a $30,000 facility fee. The Company agreed to pay to Lender monthly an unused line fee in amount equal to 0.083% per month of the difference derived by subtracting (i) the average daily outstanding balance under the Revolving Facility during the preceding month, from (ii) the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount. The unused line fee will be payable monthly in arrears. The Company also agreed to pay the Lender as additional interest a monthly collateral management fee equal to 0.35% per month calculated on the basis of the average daily balance under the Revolving Facility outstanding during the preceding month. The collateral management fee will be payable monthly in arrears. Upon a termination of the Revolving Facility, the Company agreed to pay the Lender a termination fee in an amount equal to 2% of the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount if the termination occurs before February 1, 2020. The Company must also pay certain fees in the event that receivables are not properly deposited in the appropriate lockbox account.

The interest rate will be increased by 5% in the event of a default under the Credit Agreement. Events of default under the Credit Agreement, some of which are subject to certain cure periods, include a failure to pay obligations when due, the making of a material misrepresentation to the Lender, the rendering of certain judgments or decrees against the Company and the commencement of a proceeding for the appointment of a receiver, trustee, liquidator or conservator or filing of a petition seeking reorganization or liquidation or similar relief.

The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and various affirmative and negative covenants including the right of first refusal to provide financing for the Company and the financial and loan covenants, such as the loan turnover rate, minimum EBTDA, fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum liquidity requirements.

On February 1, 2017, the Company drew $686,080.94 from the Revolving Facility, to be disbursed as follows: $628,782.94 to pay off the amount borrowed from Gibraltar Business Capital, LLC (“Gibraltar”) under the revolving accounts receivable funding agreement dated February 20, 2014 (paid off on February 1, 2017) and the balance for the closing costs.

As of February 1, 2017, the Company and Gibraltar entered into a payoff agreement (the “Payoff Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay an amount equal to the outstanding indebtedness and obligations owing from the Company to Gibraltar (the “Gibraltar Obligations”). The Payoff Agreement provided that the Payoff Agreement will confirm that, upon receipt via wire transfer of immediately available funds to Gibraltar in the aggregate amount of $628,782.94, all of the Gibraltar Obligations will be terminated and satisfied in full as of the close of business on February 1, 2017.

The Second Amendment provides for a $2.0 million bridge facility (“Bridge Facility”) under the Company’s senior revolving credit facility (“Facility”) at an annual interest rate of LIBOR (currently 0.2463%) plus 10%, to be repaid upon the earlier of December 7, 2009 and the consummation of an equity capital financing in which the Company receives net proceeds in excess of $4.9 million (a “Recapitalization Event”).
 
In addition, the Second Amendment amends the interest rates on “Base Rate” loans and “LIBOR Rate” loans under the Facility as follows:
 
 
·
“Base Rate” loan interest rates were increased from the Wells Fargo prime rate less 25 basis points to the Wells Fargo prime rate plus 175 basis points; and

In addition, upon a Recapitalization Event, the applicable percentages used in calculating the borrowing base under the Financing Agreement will be reduced.
 
In connection with the Second Amendment, the Company is required to pay the Agent a one-time amendment fee of $150,000, one half of which has been paid and the remainder will be paid upon the Recapitalization Event.

On August 25, 2020, Williams Scotsman International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“WSII”) and indirect subsidiary of WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), completed a private offering of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 4.625% senior secured notes due 2028 (the “Notes”). The Notes were sold to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

 

The offering proceeds were used to redeem (the “Redemption”) all $441 million in aggregate principal amount remaining outstanding of WSII’s 6.875% senior secured notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”), after giving effect to the redemption of 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes, as announced on July 27, 2020, and completed on August 11, 2020.

 

On August 25, 2020, WSII entered into an indenture with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, which governs the terms and conditions of the Notes.

 

The Notes will mature on August 15, 2028. They will bear an interest at a rate of 4.625% per annum. Interest will be payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2021.

 

At any time and from time to time on and after August 15, 2023, WSII, at its option, may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date falling on or prior to the redemption date)), if redeemed during the 12 month period beginning on August 15 of each of the years set forth below.

2025 and thereafter                          100.000        %
 

WSII may redeem the Notes at any time before August 15, 2023, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a customary make whole premium for the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the redemption date. At any time prior to August 15, 2023, WSII may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes at a price equal to 104.625% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the redemption date with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings. WSII may also redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes at any time prior the second anniversary of the closing date of this offering at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed during each twelve-month period commencing with the issue date, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the redemption date. If WSII undergoes a change of control or sells certain of its assets, WSII may be required to offer to repurchase the Notes.

 

The Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by each of WSII’s direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and WSII’s parent, Williams Scotsman Holdings Corp. (collectively, the “Note Guarantors”). The Company is not a guarantor of the Notes. The Note Guarantors as well as certain of WSII’s non-US subsidiaries are guarantors or borrowers under a senior secured asset based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $2.4 billion. To the extent lenders under the ABL Facility release any Note Guarantor’s guarantee of the obligations in respect of the ABL Facility (other than in connection with a repayment or satisfaction of obligations in full), such Note Guarantor will also be released from its guarantee obligations in respect of the Notes. These guarantees are secured by a second priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of WSII and the Note Guarantors (subject to customary exclusions). The guarantees of the Notes by WillScot Equipment II, LLC, which holds certain of WSII’s uncertificated assets in the United States, are subordinate to its obligations under the ABL Facility.

 

Item 1.02        Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
 

Effective as of August 26, 2020 (the “Redemption Date”), WSII redeemed all $441 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2023 Notes (after giving effect to the redemption of 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes, as announced on July 27, 2020, and completed on August 11, 2020) at a redemption price equal to 103.438% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the Redemption Date, and the indenture dated as of August 6, 2018, by and among WSII, as successor to Mason Finance Sub, Inc., the guarantors party thereto and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, as supplemented by the Supplemental Indentures dated August 15, 2018 and July 1, 2020, was terminated.

Torvec Inc. held its annual shareholders meeting on Thursday January 29th, 2009.  At this meeting the nominees presented to the shareholders for election as directors were approved by a majority vote exceeding 99% of the total votes cast.   At the same meeting the audit committee's appointment of Eisner LLP as the company's independent registered accounting firm for the company's fiscal year ended December 31st 2008 was ratified by over 99% of the total votes cast. In excess of 83% of the total number of issued and outstanding common shares eligible to vote participated by voting in person or proxy at the annual meeting. Approximately 13 million nonaffiliated common shares participated by voting at the meeting, with approximately 12.8 million common shares voting in favor of management. Attached to this Form 8-K is the text of the presentation delivered by James Y. Gleasman, the company's Chief Executive Officer.                 James Y. Gleasman Presentation --

- - 2009 Annual meeting    I would like to begin tonight's presentation with a question----- Where were you on September 15, 2008?   It would have taken a prophet indeed to predict that the announcement on that day that Lehman Brothers was filing for bankruptcy would usher in the most catastrophic economic crisis since the Great Depression.  Such familiar names as Merrill, Lynch, Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual, Countrywide, Wachovia would disappear off the map.  Others, such as AIG, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would face monumental restructuring to survive.  The auto industry was not immune-----headlines such as ""GM Production Plunges in Crisis""; ""Economy Decimates Dealerships""; ""Chrysler's Future Uncertain"" became commonplace.  And, a new word has taken center-stage in our country's discussions of what to do.  The word?---------------""bailout."" Yet, despite an economic crisis not seen since the 1930s, a stock market implosion

and the ever-present possibility of terrorist attacks, we, as shareholders, gather here tonight knowing that 1. Torvec is not going bankrupt, in spite of not receiving $900,000 in revenues from our sale of the Dartmouth ice technology license; 2. Torvec has not needed a ""bailout"" to survive because Torvec has no institutional debt and has never had institutional debt in its history;  3. Torvec has not had to lay off anybody, our people are busier than ever and, if certain events that I will describe tonight take place, Torvec will need to hire significant more personnel; 4. Despite the fact that the stock prices of many well known companies fell like a spaceship in some cosmic black hole, Torvec's stock price has held relatively firm during this crisis and on many trading days, actually traded up when many other stocks were sinking. I think all of us can be thankful that Torvec has been structured to survive even the most catastrophic economic shocks. However,

we are not just interested in surviving but in economic success which benefits all shareholders.  And, we are very optimistic that success will be ours. Now, let's talk specifics. The Infinitely Variable Transmission How many watched the President Obama's Inaugural Parade? Did you notice NASA's lunar rover proudly rolling down Pennsylvania Avenue?  Weren't you pleased, as a shareholder to know that your company's IsoTorque technology was in the vehicle and that additional Torvec technology will be installed shortly? Please recall that in July, 2007, we shipped seven IsoTorque differentials to NASA for installation in the lunar rover. Please also recall that at the 2006 shareholders meeting, we showed you an infinitely variable transmission which we had specifically designed for the lunar rover. We shipped that unit shortly after the meeting and NASA was impressed with the functionality and performance of the unit.  NA

SA next told us that it was going to upgrade the lunar rover to meet additional payload and performance requirements and requested that Torvec design the IVT to accommodate these upgrades.  We have completed the advanced design and are building seven IVTs for NASA's next generation lunar rover for delivery in early spring, 2009. Andy will give you a more complete update later. The IsoTorque(r) Differential Torvec's success with NASA has ignited the interest of quite a few companies who want to license or otherwise acquire our IsoTorque technology.  1. Early last summer, we provided an IsoTorque differential to a major American automotive manufacturer for evaluation for its rear-wheel drive vehicles.  The evaluation process went extremely well and the manufacturer has recently furnished us with an axle so that we can integrate our IsoTorque technology for its front-wheel drive vehicles.  We believe our IsoTorque technology will enable the manuf

acturer to eliminate a phenomenon that has plagued front-wheel drive cars for years---""torque-steer.""   Later tonight Andy will provide you with a demonstration of what we are talking about and why we think we have a solution which will help put this manufacturer back on the map. We anticipate that, as the result of our efforts, the manufacturer will license our IsoTorque technology for use in six models of its entire automotive fleet. 2.  Similarly, a manufacturer of axles for medium duty trucks, in other words, trucks the size of Federal Express and UPS trucks, and heavy-duty trucks, such as tractor-trailers, has been working with us since last year. The company wants to use our IsoTorque to create an active differential control device for improved tractive capability for use within the manufacturer's on-highway axle portfolio.  This company is also working with us to develop drive-line products for military severe duty vehicle use.  We last met with the man

ufacturer as recently as January, 2009 to continue to further develop our relationship. 3. A major truck manufacturer has asked that we re-design the axle it uses for its heavy-duty truck line to enable us to integrate our IsoTorque technology.  The manufacturer has recently delivered the axle to us and preparations are in place for a meeting during the first week of February to kick off this project.  Given the size of the manufacturer, its world-wide reputation and its place in the automotive world, this project could result in a very profitable license arrangement. The Full Terrain Vehicle 1. After working with us for almost a year, the U.S. Air Force purchased a Torvec Full Terrain Vehicle in October, 2008 and formed a partnership with Torvec to create an Advanced Combat Firefighting Vehicle capable of unprecedented speed, maneuverability with diverse applications for use in the most extreme and rugged terrain.  We delivered the FTV five months ahead of schedule

and the Air Force has used the time well to maximize the FTVs combat firefighting capabilities, including its robotic and autonomous potential, at Tyndale Air Force Base in Florida.  At the same time, the Air Force is providing engineering and fabrication support in developing the firefighting payload in accordance with Air Force specifications. I believe this partnership is very important for Torvec: First, credibility.----------------------Air Force personnel have told us that the FTV is the most advanced tracked vehicle in the world and backed this claim with a ""sole source"" purchase order which means that there is no competitive bidding involved; Second, after the Air Force has completed its evaluation and modification of the FTV for its project, we will build and they will receive a ""second generation"" model based upon their recommendations.  This unit will serve as the basis for a Torvec-Air Force contract to furnish FTVs for the Air Force's needs; Third, ba

sed upon our dealings with the Air Force, we anticipate that other branches of the U.S. military, the Department of Homeland Security, FEMA, the U.S. Forestry Service, as well as state and municipal governmental units, will purchase design-specific FTVs for---------------------boarder patrol; --------------off-highway emergencies; --------------as an environmentally-friendly vehicle for federal and state conservation and drug-enforcement efforts; and, as a fast, highly maneuverable vehicle for combat and non-combat uses. 2. The credibility we received as a result of our Air Force involvement strengthened our negotiating position with a major automotive manufacturer interested in creating an additional marketing niche for high-speed tracked vehicles worldwide.  For the better part of a year, we have been seriously engaged in discussing the pros and cons of an FTV joint venture partnership with this automotive manufacturer.   As the result of our success with the Air Force, this man

ufacturer altered its negotiating position to seek more involvement with the manufacture and marketing of the FTV by producing the majority of the substructure and the use of its entire worldwide dealer network.  As a result, in early December, the manufacturer placed on the table a proposal whereby they would license the rights to produce and market the FTV from Torvec.  Torvec and the manufacturer would enter into a supply contract under which Torvec would sell the steer-drive and three IsoTorque differentials for each FTV and receive a royalty equal to $10,000 for each FTV sold.  Torvec, therefore, would profit from selling the components necessary to to enable the FTV to function while at the same time, make a $10,000 bottom-line profit on every vehicle sold.  That translates into a $50,000,000 profit for every 5,000 vehicles sold.  This profit would go directly to Torvec's bottom line. I want to emphasize, here, that while this proposal is very lucrative for us,

the proposal is their proposal.  And, it will be far easier to finalize a license arrangement than a joint venture agreement. We feel very comfortable that, if this license arrangement is finalized, it would represent a major, ""watershed"" event for Torvec.  It certainly would enable us to fulfill our goal of listing our common stock on NASDAQ or a stock exchange.  The announcement of such a deal probably would increase our stock price considerably.  And, consider this. The revenues generated by this license, together with revenues obtained from the other transactions described tonight, will more than cover our operating costs and would put us in a position to declare a significant portion of the $10,000 per FTV royalty number as a dividend to our shareholders each year.  This is especially the case since our nearly $50,000,000 in operating losses will insulate our first revenues from federal and state taxes. The continuing economic crisis has slowed our progress towards rea

ching a final, written agreement.  In addition, the President of the division who has spearheaded this project on behalf of the manufacturer has recently been promoted to corporate headquarters as the company's new Vice-President of International Trade and has been placed in charge of the project in his new capacity.  Needless to say, we feel quite good about the possibilities here. General Concluding Thoughts As I have stated before, I remain very optimistic about Torvec's future. I believe we have made very, very significant progress since we reassumed control of the company in mid-2005.  By and large, we have taken and are continuing to take the steps necessary to commercialize our products and increase the value of our company for our shareholders.  For example, the announcement of any one of the potential business arrangements I just discussed would significantly increase our stock price and perhaps enable Torvec to declare dividends.  Mo

reover, such an announcement would enable us to get off the OTC--Bulletin Board and become listed on NASDAQ where, among other things, our stock price would not be at the mercy of market makers, Torvec would become eligible for trading by institutional funds and we could be followed by automotive analysts familiar with the automotive industry. Introduction of  Andrew Gleasman At this time, I normally would turn the microphone over to Keith.  Tonight, I will be turning it over to Andy Gleasman. As many of you know, Andy has been fully immersed with all of the Gleasman family's inventions since he was twelve.  He sat on his grandfather's knee and absorbed our founder's knowledge and the knowledge base and skill sets of Keith and myself.  Andrew Gleasman is a graduate of Rochester Institute of Technology where he strengthened his background with courses in Management Information Systems, political science and criminal justice.  Over the

past five years, Andy has been involved in all aspects of Torvec's business, from working on the infinitely variable transmission, the FTV, our CVjoints and especially our IsoTorque differential, to assisting in corporate administration and management, to his role as Technology Manager in charge of our computer network and website webmaster. Andy literally ""has done it all."" More importantly, Andy has participated in almost all of the meetings with executives at every level which Torvec has had over the past number of years and is responsible for a considerable amount of the success we have had in attracting companies to our products. We have found that many of the people we have worked with are Andy's peers----for example, a key contact on Hillary Clinton's staff graduated from the same high school as Andy; our NASA contacts generally are persons in their late twenties and early thirties; members of the racing teams we are working with are Andy's age; More importantly, we have found that as we actually work with companies on specific projects, Andy's involvement, on a day-to-day basis, with their personnel increased to such an extent that he became the actual ""point person"" for Torvec in the relationship. In view of all this, we thought that Andy would be the logical person to describe where we are with many of these projects in more depth.

Tunicom Property Sale and Distribution

All-State Properties, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership

(the ""Company""), owns a 36.12% member interest (the ""Tunicom

Interest"") in Tunicom LLC, a Florida limited liability company

(""Tunicom"").  The Tunicom Interest is the only asset of the

Company.  The Company has no operating business and no source of

current income.

On December 19, 2006, Tunicom sold its sole asset, 5 acres

of undeveloped commercial and residential land located in

Lauderhill, Florida to FTMI Real Estate, LLC for a total

purchase price of $1,800,000 paid in cash at closing.  After

deducting expenses related to the sale, including a fee of

$250,000 paid by Tunicom to the general partner of the Company

for his assistance in obtaining necessary permits and consents,

governmental and otherwise, required under the agreement of

purchase and sale and also for his assistance to the buyer in

securing the required financing, Tunicom distributed a net

amount of $1,270,000 to its members, of which the Company's

share was $458,643.47.  As previously reported by the Company,

Tunicom's arrangement with the Company's general partner was

unanimously approved by the members of Tunicom with the Company

and its general partner abstaining in May 2002.

From the distribution paid to the Company, the Company paid

Tunicom $247,561.80, representing the principal amount of, plus

accrued and unpaid interest on, loans made by Tunicom (the

""Tunicom Loan"") to pay the expenses of the Company relating to

its status as a public company, including accounting and audit

fees and expenses, stock transfer agent fees, and printing and

mailing costs relating to the Company's annual report and K-1s

sent to its partners.

On or about February 6, 2007, the Company intends to make a

final distribution to its partners in an aggregate amount of

$211,081.67, or about $0.05 per partnership unit.  This amount

represents the net amount of cash received by the Company after

payment of the Tunicom Loan, and payment of a fee of $11,678.42,

based on a percentage of the net distribution to the Company's

partners, to certain individuals who had made cash advances to

Tunicom on behalf of the Company.  The final distribution is

also net of a reserve of $50,000 (""Reserve"") set aside by the

Company for the payment of estimated expenses relating to

winding down the Company, including stock transfer agent fees,

and the preparation, printing and mailing of current and final

K-1s and the Company's financial statements for its year ended

June 30, 2006.  Following completion of the distribution, the

Company will have no assets other than the Reserve.

Revised Terms with Longdan on Possible Acquisition

As previously reported, the Company entered into a letter

of intent (""LOI"") with Hubei Longdan Biological Medicine

Technology Co. Ltd. (""Longdan""), a company organized under the

laws of the People's Republic of China (the ""PRC"").  Longdan is

engaged in the production and sale of pharmaceutical products in

the PRC.  Under the LOI, the Company and Longdan agreed to

certain parameters for the acquisition by the Company of all of

the outstanding capital stock of Longdan (the ""Acquisition"").

The LOI has expired by its terms but the Company and Longdan

have continued to negotiate the terms of a possible Acquisition.

Under the terms of the LOI, it was contemplated that the

Company would convert from a limited partnership to a Delaware

corporation and form a Delaware corporation into which Longdan

would merge.  However, Longdan has advised the Company that the

laws of the PRC place limitations on the foreign ownership of

Chinese companies.  In addition, there have been changes in the

business of Longdan that, together with the limitation on

foreign ownership, have required a renegotiation of the terms of

the possible Acquisition.

In anticipation of the possible Acquisition, on December

20, 2006, Longdan entered into certain agreements with Longdan

International Inc., a newly-formed company incorporated under

the laws of Nevis (""Longdan International"").  Pursuant to these

agreements, Longdan International provides exclusive technology

consulting and other general business operations services to

Longdan in return for payment of consulting fees that are equal

to Longdan's net profits.  Longdan's shareholders have pledged

their equity interests in Longdan to Longdan International to

secure the contract obligations and have granted Longdan

International an irrevocable proxy to vote their interests and

an exclusive option to purchase these interests, which

arrangements are enforceable to the fullest extent permitted

under the laws of the PRC.

Longdan has advised the Company that this arrangement has

been used by other PRC companies that have been acquired by U.S.

public companies and has further advised that it believes that

this structure qualifies Longdan International as a variable

interest entity that is permitted to consolidate its financial

statements with Longdan, the operating entity with which it has

qualifying contractual arrangements.

The Company has reached an informal unwritten agreement in

principal with Longdan International on revised terms of an

Acquisition that if consummated would result in Longdan

International's shareholders receiving shares of the Company

equal to approximately eighty nine  percent (89%) of the

Company's issued and outstanding capital stock for their shares

of Longdan International with the balance of approximately

eleven percent (11%) of the outstanding capital stock of the

Company being held by the Company's existing

partners/stockholders. Under the terms of the LOI the Company's

partners/stockholders would have owned nine percent (9%) of the

Company after consummation of the Acquisition.

Under the revised terms, the Company would have two classes

of capital stock (Class A Common and Class B Common) that would

be equal in all respects, including with respect to dividends

and other distributions, except that the Class A Common,

representing five percent (5%) of the Company's total

outstanding capital stock, would be held by the current

controlling shareholders of Longdan and would have ten (10)

votes for each share, while all other stockholders, including

the Company's partners/stockholders, would hold Class B Common

Stock which would have one (1) vote per share.  Longdan

International would agree that the capital structure of the

Company would not change for two (2) years, subject to certain

exceptions for capital stock issued in financing transactions.

Longdan has agreed to pay all costs associated with a

possible Acquisition, including legal fees incurred in

connection with the related corporate law transactions and

required filings under the securities laws, and has also agreed

to pay for any costs incurred by the Company in connection with

maintaining its registration under the Securities Exchange Act

of 1934, as amended, from the time of the final distribution to

its partners until the earlier of consummation of a Acquisition

or termination of negotiations.

As previously reported, the Company received $3.5 million from Genzyme at the closing of the transaction and was eligible to receive up to an additional $3.5 million upon the achievement of seven technology transfer milestones.  The Company completed all seven technology transfer milestones and received aggregate payments from Genzyme of $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2010 for a total of $3.5 million.   In addition, the Company reported today that it received a $750,000 milestone payment from Amsterdam Molecular Therapeutics B.V. (""AMT"").  This milestone payment was received pursuant to a patent license agreement between the C

ompany and AMT and was triggered by AMT's filing for marketing approval of Glybera(r), a product candidate for  the treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficient patients.  AMT announced the regulatory filing with the European Medicines Agency on January 11, 2010. The Company estimates it finished 2009 with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $4.9 million. The Company intends over the next year to utilize its resources to support continued efforts to monetize certain assets, to realize value from milestone and royalty licensing relationships, and to support product development programs currently underway with commercial and academic partners. Accordingly, based on its current business plans, the Company expects its net use of cash during 2010 will not exceed $2 million. The Company's use of cash in 2010 could be greater if the Company decides to increase spending during the year on new or current programs or other operating activities.  As previously reported, under the September 2009 asset purchase a

greement, the Company sold manufacturing technologies and other adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector technology to Genzyme.  Under the agreement, Genzyme agreed to pay up to $7 million for the assets and the successful transfer of the technology and also agreed to pay a portion of sublicensing revenue received during a specified timeframe and royalties on net product sales of products if Genzyme successfully commercializes products utilizing the acquired Targeted Genetics' technology.  The Company entered into a non-exclusive patent license agreement with AMT in 2006 which covers Glybera.  The license agreement provides for AMT to pay royalties on net product sales, milestone payments upon the achievement of certain product development targets and annual maintenance payments.

members of the MCOA management team and will continue as a management team for

EBRx subsequent to the Merger. This minority investment in MCOA will help ensure

the ongoing continuity of the business of EBRx and promote its further

expansion. HealthExtras and the Shareholders each have certain rights, based on

subsequent performance of EBRx to purchase or require the repurchase, as the

case may be, of shares held by the Shareholders for amounts which vary based on

future performance of EBRx.

The Merger Agreement also contains usual and customary representations

and warranties that HealthExtras and MCOA made to each other as of specific

dates. The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties were made

solely for purposes of the contract between HealthExtras and MCOA, and may be

subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in

connection with negotiating its terms. Moreover, the representations and

warranties are subject to a contractual standard of materiality that may be

different from what may be viewed as material to shareholders, and the

representations and warranties may have been used for the purpose of allocating

The

Company is very excited to announce the launch its new relationship with BBD and Green Shield in Canada and continue to

introduce our PHZIO treatment platform to the employee benefits industry and add this additional silo of business to our growing

list of candidate users of our PHZIO platform. We believe that we have created a strong path to lowering the spending on employee

benefits claims through the utilization of our PHZIO digital PT treatment platform and are pleased to be in a position to share

what we believe is our ""revolutionary"" cost savings technology with the employee benefits industry.

Our PHZIO platform has been developed to significantly

support us in our goal of becoming the leader in the new industry of digital telehealth physical therapy (""dPT"").

Our focus is to highlight that a majority of all future PT treatments can be accomplished with a smart phone and similar digital

technology. This new digital adoption should lower patient treatment costs, expand patient treatment access and improve

patient compliance. Our PHZIO platform allows patients and PT's to cut the cord from the ""old-school,""

wait-in-line, brick and mortar clinical experience to an immediate response digital, in-home PT experience.

We firmly believe that as much as 80% of all PT assessments and treatments can now be done on a patient's smart phone

in the privacy of their own home. It is our position that Digital PT is clearly the next upgrade the industry needs to

make.

Margin Loan

Sapphire Holding S.a r.l.

To secure $125.0 million of borrowings under the Loan Agreement, Sapphire pledged all  49,041,906 shares of our Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share ( Common Stock ), that it owns (the  Pledged Shares ), and any shares of Common Stock that Sapphire may acquire upon conversion of its common shares of Williams Scotsman Holding Corp. pursuant to an exchange agreement. Borrowings under the Loan Agreement represent a loan-to-value ratio of approximately 15.8%, based on the closing price ($16.15) of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market on August 22, 2018, and the Pledged Shares represent approximately 52.3% of our Common Stock outstanding as of August 22, 2018. The loan will mature on August 23, 2020.

We are not a party to the Loan Agreement and we have no obligations thereunder, but we have delivered an issuer agreement to the Lenders pursuant to which we have, among other things, agreed to certain obligations relating to the Pledged Shares and, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules, agreed not to take any actions that are intended to materially hinder or delay the exercise of any remedies with respect to the Pledged Shares.

The Company has been informed by Sapphire that the Loan Agreement contains customary default provisions. In the event of a default under the Loan Agreement by Sapphire, the Lenders and their affiliates and assignees may foreclose upon any and all Pledged Shares.

The release of Common Stock from escrow, termination of the lock-up restrictions pertaining to the warrants and the subsequent transfer of a portion of such warrants to Sapphire were respectively triggered by the occurrence of certain events under the terms of the Earnout Agreement, in amounts mutually agreed to by the parties thereto.  The shares of Common Stock released to Sapphire comprise a portion of the Pledged Shares under the margin loan described above.

As a result of the depletion of all shares of Common Stock from escrow and termination of the lock-up period thereunder, the Earnout Agreement has automatically terminated in accordance with its terms and, upon termination of the Earnout Agreement, the Escrow Agreement also terminated in accordance with its terms.

and outstanding share of Company common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "" Peak Common Stock "") (other than (x) shares

of Peak Common Stock held by Peak Bio as treasury stock, or shares of Peak Common Stock owned by Akari, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect

Agreement (the "" Exchange Ratio ""), each such share duly and validly issued against the deposit of the requisite number

of Akari Ordinary Shares in accordance with the Deposit Agreement (as defined in the Merger Agreement). The Exchange Ratio will be calculated

such that the total number of shares of Akari ADSs to be issued as merger consideration for the Peak Common Stock will be expected to

in respect of the net cash, as determined in accordance with the Merger Agreement, of each of Akari and Peak Bio at the close of business

one business day prior to the anticipated consummation of the Merger). The Merger Agreement provides that, under certain circumstances,

additional Akari ADSs may be issued to the holders of shares of Peak Common Stock following the consummation of the Merger equal to an

exchange ratio calculated in accordance with the Merger Agreement (the "" Additional Exchange Ratio "").

At the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase

and the exercise price with respect to each Akari Ordinary Share (or each Akari Ordinary Share underlying Akari ADSs, as applicable)

underlying such Adjusted Warrant will be equal to the exercise price of such Peak Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time divided

by the Exchange Ratio. The grant of the Adjusted Warrants will be effected as of the Effective Time, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably

practicable, taking into account Parent's administrative procedures. The Adjusted Warrants will be further adjusted, if applicable,

to give effect to the impact of the Additional Exchange Ratio.

Each option to acquire shares of Peak Common

Stock ("" Peak Option "") that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not

vested, will be assumed and converted into an option to purchase a number of Akari ordinary shares or Akari ADSs, as determined by Akari

(each, an "" Adjusted Option ""). The number of Akari Ordinary Shares (or the number of Akari Ordinary Shares underlying

Akari ADSs, as applicable) subject to the Adjusted Option will be equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Peak

Common Stock subject to such Peak Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, with any

fractional Akari Ordinary Shares or Akari ADSs rounded down to the nearest whole Akari Ordinary Share or Akari ADS, as applicable, and

the exercise price per share of each Adjusted Option will be equal to the exercise price of such Peak Option immediately prior to the

Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio. The Adjusted Options will be further adjusted, if applicable, to give effect to the impact

of the Additional Exchange Ratio.

The Merger Agreement contains customary representations,

warranties and covenants given by Akari, Peak Bio and Merger Sub. The Merger Agreement also contains customary pre-closing covenants,

including covenants by each of the parties relating to conduct of their respective business prior to the closing of the Merger.  In

addition, the parties have agreed to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary, proper or advisable

to complete the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including making any required regulatory filings

with respect to the Merger as promptly as reasonably practicable, except that neither Akari nor Peak Bio is required to divest any assets

or businesses of Peak Bio, Akari or any of their respective affiliates and subsidiaries.

The Merger Agreement

also provides that, from the earlier of the Effective Time of the Merger and termination of the Merger Agreement, each of Akari and Peak

Bio is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to solicit acquisition proposals from third parties, to provide information to

third parties and to engage in discussions with third parties regarding acquisition proposals, subject to customary exceptions. In addition,

the board of directors of each of Akari and Peak Bio are required to recommend that their respective shareholders or stockholders vote

in favor of the Merger, subject to exceptions for superior proposals and other situations where failure to effect a recommendation change

would be inconsistent with such board's fiduciary duties.

Consummation of the Merger is subject to various

conditions, including, among others, (i) approval of the Merger Agreement and Merger by Peak Bio stockholders, (ii) Akari's

shareholders authorizing Akari's board of directors to allot all Akari ordinary shares to be issued in connection with the Merger

(to be represented by Akari ADSs), (iii) the absence of any law or order prohibiting consummation of the Merger, (iv) Akari's

Registration Statement on Form S-4 (to be issued in connection with the Merger) having been declared effective, (v) the Akari

ADSs issuable to Peak Bio stockholders having been authorized for listing on Nasdaq, (vi) accuracy of the other party's representations

and warranties (subject to certain materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement), (vii) compliance by the other party

in all material respects with such other party's obligations under the Merger Agreement; (viii) the absence of a material

adverse effect on the other party, (ix) the other party's net cash being greater than negative $13,500,000 and (x) the

PIPE Investment (as defined in the Merger Agreement) shall have been consummated simultaneously with, and conditioned only upon, the

occurrence of the closing, and shall result in net proceeds to Akari of at least $10,000,000.

Either Akari or Peak Bio may terminate the Merger

Agreement under certain circumstances, including if (i) the Merger is not completed by September 4, 2024, (ii) the

other party's board of directors withdraws, modifies or qualifies its recommendation in favor of the transactions contemplated by the

Merger Agreement or approves or recommends an alternative transaction or (iii) Akari's or Peak Bio's board of directors,

as applicable, resolves to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal prior to obtaining approval of the Akari

ADS issuance or Merger, as applicable, from Akari's shareholders or Peak Bio's stockholders, as applicable. The Merger Agreement

also provides that under certain specified circumstances of termination described in the Merger Agreement, Akari or Peak Bio, as applicable,

will be required to pay a termination fee equal to $300,000 and reimburse the other party for expenses related to the transaction up

to $1.5 million.

On

February 14, 2017, the Registrant was served by a complaint filed by Rodney Schoemann (""Schoemann"") in the State of

Louisiana, in which Schoemann alleged that the Registrant was indebted to Schoemann under a series of promissory note underlying

loans in the original principal amount of $75,500 (the ""Notes""), of which $45,202 had been repaid by the Registrant.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Schoemann claimed in his lawsuit that, as a result of alleged defaults and extensions of the Notes,

the Registrant was indebted in the amount of $253,677 inclusive of interest and penalties at an effective rate exceeding 70% per

annum, far in excess of the maximum rate allowable either in Louisiana, where Schoemann resided, or in California where the Note

was executed, and the loans were made. In addition, Schoemann further claimed that he had the right to exercise warrants to acquire

a total of 2.8 million shares of the Registrant's Common Stock at an adjusted conversion price of $0.005 per share.

The

asserted as affirmative defenses that: (i) Schoemann is not a licensed lender in the State of California, where the loans were

made and the $75,500 was deposited and therefore was not permitted under California law to make loans in California; (ii) the

interest rate Schoemann is seeking to collect is usurious and therefore interest claimed in the lawsuit is neither collectible

nor enforceable; and (iii) the warrants were void and evidenced the usurious nature of the loans in violation of the applicable

laws of the States of California and Louisiana. The Registrant and its counsel were of the opinion that the Schoemann suit was

wholly without merit and furthermore filed a motion that the action should be removed from Louisiana state court to the United

States Federal District Court in Baton Rouge, LA, where California law should be applied.

On

June 20, 2018, the Registrant and Schoemann entered into a Settlement Agreement pursuant to which Schoemann's complaint

and all claims sought by Schoemann, including all monies, penalties and warrants, were dismissed with prejudice and, in consideration,

the Registrant agreed to issue to Schoemann a total of 4 million shares of Common Stock (the ""Settlement Shares""),

subject to the following conditions: (i) the Settlement Shares are to be held at a brokerage firm designated by the Registrant;

(ii) 2,709,444 of the Settlement Shares shall be immediately tradeable under SEC Rule 144, but subject at all times to a daily

trading limit of 25,000 Settlement Shares per day; and (iii) the remaining 1,290,556 Settlement Shares shall be subject to a 180-day

30 Gould Street, Suite R, Sheridan, WY 82801, represented by Mr. Henry D. Fahman, its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,

hereinafter referred to as ""PGG or ""the Registrant,"" signed a Business Development and Structuring Consultancy

Agreement and agreed to undertake the followings:

RECITALS

WHEREAS ,

the Company has been desirous of a establishing a compartmentalized regulated/unregulated Bank Fund (RAIF) in Luxembourg, the Asian Diamond

Exchange and the International Financial Center in Vietnam.

WHEREAS ,

the Company entered into a business structuring contract and Luxembourg Bank Fund set-up contract with the Consultant in Luxembourg on

November 30, 2017 and an additional contract (containing additional fee contributions to the Consultant) between the parties on October

4, 2018 in Hanoi, Vietnam.

The

content of the contracts was the establishing of a compartmentalized regulated/unregulated Luxembourg Bank Fund (RAIF) and following

this the set-up and establishing of the Asian Diamond Exchange for rough and polished diamond trade and the reconsolidating of the lab-grown

diamond industry in Vietnam.

In

a first instance, and in collaboration with the Chu Lai Free Economic Zone in Quang Nam Province, Vietnam, all was organized and paid

for by the Consultant in order to start the operation on May 15, 2018. Numerous efforts and the establishing of expert teams, headed

by the Consultant were done to make this venture happen.

After

DLP Law Firm was paid and with complete financial interventions by and financial backing, funding and guarantees done by the Consultant,

the Luxembourg Bank Fund PHILUX GLOBAL FUNDS, SCA, SICAV- RAIF was established and delivered on May 20, 2020 and the full approval of

the Fund was certified by the Luxembourg Bank Regulator (the 'CSSF') and on May 22, 2020.

The

Consultant has been leading full-time a group of experts for the setup of the Asian Diamond Exchange (""ADE"") since January

2018. All costs thereto were advanced and paid by the Consultant from 2018 up till now and fractional reimbursements for costs have been

obtained from the Company.

The

Consultant has brought together the 11 main trading players in the rough diamond industry to come to Vietnam. He has established a partnership

with the biggest player in the rough trading and polishing group and other main international diamond trading groups have also joined

the overall venture.

Furthermore,

together with the groups, a full Kimberly Process Certification Scheme (KPC) to prevent 'conflict diamond' trading was established

and is aligned from time to time. Also, the new lab grown diamond KPC scheduling is already implemented. A unique and KPC approved structure

has been established where under the PHI Vietnam umbrella, in collaboration with KPC Mumbai, India, a ""Public-Private-Partnership""

(PPP) was established in which the Vietnamese authorities would hold 15% and PHI or its local corporate entity would hold 85% of the

voting rights. For the lab grown diamond segment, this has been planned in the Chu Lai Free Economic Zone and for the Rough and Polished

Diamond Parcel Trade, this is being planned on Thanh Da Peninsula, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

PHI

took the decision to move the greater part of the ADE rough and polishing venture, first to an Industrial Zone to be established close

to the new international Airport in Long Thanh District, Dong Nai Province, Vietnam and this year to the Thanh Da Island, which is 5

km from the center of Ho Chi Minh City. This location change has caused the entire KPC Process and administration to be adapted and redone

with renewed financial input, mostly carried by the Consultant.

A

rough diamond trading export flow to Vietnam was negotiated and concluded by the Consultant with the Dubai Multi-Commodities Center (DMCC)

and Dubai Diamond Exchange. It is the Consultant who also set up and established the Dubai Diamond Exchange in 2002-2005.

In

2023, an international diamond trading platform was created by the Consultant to unify the trading efforts of three major international

trading groups with the advice and counsel thereto by the senior board member of the largest group.

Together

with the afore-mentioned board member of the largest group, the Consultant has also covered the financial backbone of the diamond trading

venture via the setup of a financial institution in Botswana. It is the intention of the Consultant to donate and transfer 50% of his

own voting shares of the institution to PHI the moment all budgets for the venture are arranged by PHI and all financial obligations

and reimbursements by PHI to him are met. It is the intention of the parties involved to establish a subsidiary of the financial institution

in the ADE Vietnam and have local banking partners join this initiative.

The

Consultant has also established a collaboration partnership with the Antwerp Diamond Exchange (Belgium), the Dubai Diamond Exchange and

the Tel-Aviv Diamond Exchange for the ADE.

Recently,

the Consultant has started a structuring project, in order for PHI to set up and establish an International Financial Center on the Thanh

Da Peninsula, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam in connection with the Asian Diamond Exchange. This will be similar as what the Consultant has

established successfully for Dubai in 2002-2005 and this now incorporating the international changes of the last decade.

Once

PHI has effectuated all budgeting and all financial requirements and obligations, the ongoing process will effectively materialize, and

the Consultant then shall transfer the entire venture to PHI.

NOW

THEREFORE , in consideration of the terms, promises, conditions and mutual covenants herein contained, and each intending to be legally

bound hereby, the Consultant and Company are parties to this Agreement and agree as follows:

A.   Business Development and Structuring Consultancy Services.

acceleration of the vesting of unvested stock options having an exercise price

of more than $0.92 per share granted under the Company's Amended and Restated

2000 Stock Incentive Plan that are held by the Company's employees, including

executive officers.

As a result of this action, options to purchase 1,931,244 shares of the

Company's common stock became immediately exercisable, representing

approximately 17.2% of the Company's total outstanding options.

Because the accelerated options had exercise prices in excess of the

current market value of the Company's common stock, they were not fully

achieving their original objectives of incentive compensation and employee

retention. The Company expects the acceleration to have a positive effect on

employee morale, retention, and perception of option value.

The acceleration is also intended to eliminate future compensation

expense the Company would otherwise have to recognize in its income statement

with respect to the accelerated options once Statement of Financial Accounting

Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), ""Share-Based Payment,"" issued by the Financial

On December 23, 2014, eWellness Healthcare

Corporation (f/k/a Dignyte, Inc.) (the ""Company"", ""we"", ""us"", ""our"") held an initial

closing of its private offering of up to $1,200,000 Series A Senior Convertible Redeemable Notes (the ""Notes"") (such

transaction, the ""Offering""). The minimum amount of the Offering is $50,000.

Pursuant to the initial closing, we

received aggregate gross proceeds of $202,500, which includes $130,000 we previously received pursuant to the promissory notes

we issued for that same amount (the ""Promissory Notes"") and which, by its terms, automatically converted into the

securities issuable pursuant to the Offering, and issued an aggregate of convertible notes and warrants to purchase up to 578,571

shares of our common stock to four (4) accredited investors (collectively, the ""Investors"").

The Notes are being offered on a ""best

efforts"" basis in the Offering. The Notes pay a 12.0% cash coupon, payable at maturity (or upon conversion or redemption);

accrued unpaid interest shall be payable in shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 (the ""Common Stock""

) upon conversion at the option of the Investors. The Notes are senior in rank to any other debt and may not be subordinated to

any other debt of the Company, without the appropriate consent from the Note holders. The Notes are secured by the Company's

assets, including cash flow. Following the date that the Securities and Exchange Commission declares a Registration Statement

registering the shares of our common stock underlying the Notes and Warrants (as hereafter defined) effective, the Notes may be

converted by the Investors into shares of Common Stock (the shares of Common Stock underlying the Notes are hereinafter referred

to as the ""Note Shares"") at a conversion price of $0.35 per share (the ""Conversion Price""). In the event

the Common Stock shall be listed on a U.S. stock exchange and trade, as determined by the daily closing price, for twenty (20)

consecutive trading days at or above $1.50 per share, we may redeem the Notes, in cash or shares of common stock and the holder

may elect to convert the Notes into Common Stock at the Conversion Price. Upon an Event of Default, which event shall remain un-remedied

for a period of sixty (60) days, the Investors shall have the option to require the Company to redeem its outstanding Notes at

a price equal to 150% of the principal amount being redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. As long as any of the Notes

shall remain outstanding, the Investors shall be extended standard anti-dilution protection with respect to stock splits, stock

dividends and recapitalizations affecting any outstanding Notes. Each investor shall also receive a warrant (the ""Warrants"")

to purchase that number of shares of Common Stock as is equal to 100% of the number of Common Stock underlying the investor's

Note (such shares of common stock underlying the Warrants are hereinafter referred to as the ""Warrant Shares"") at

an exercise price of $0.35 per share (the ""Exercise Price"").

We also agreed to register the shares of Common

Stock underlying the Notes and Warrants in a registration statement on Form S-1, which we hope to do within the next thirty days.

The loan evidenced by the Note is also secured by all of our assets, including all proceeds from and in respect thereof, as well

as our cash flows, pursuant to a Security and Pledge Agreement.

Purchase Agreement, Note, Warrant, Registration Rights Agreement and Security and Pledge Agreement do not purport to be complete

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking

Statements

This Current Report

on Form 8-K contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws with respect to the proposed

transaction between Xos and NextGen, including statements regarding the benefits of the transaction, the anticipated timing of

the transaction and the products and markets of Xos. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words ""believe,""

""future,"" ""opportunity,"" ""plan,"" ""may,"" ""should,"" ""will,""

""would,"" ""will be,"" ""will continue,"" ""will likely result,"" and similar expressions.

Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations

and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual future events to differ

materially from the forward-looking statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including but not limited to: (i) the risk that

the transaction may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, which may adversely affect the price of NextGen's securities,

(ii) the risk that the transaction may not be completed by NextGen's business combination deadline and the potential failure

to obtain an extension of the business combination deadline if sought by NextGen, (iii) the failure to satisfy the conditions to

the consummation of the transaction, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the shareholders of NextGen, the satisfaction

of the minimum Trust Account amount following redemptions by NextGen's public shareholders and the receipt of certain governmental

and regulatory approvals, (iv) the lack of a third party valuation in determining whether or not to pursue the proposed transaction,

(v) the inability to complete the PIPE Investment, (vi) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give

rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement, (vii) the effect of the announcement or pendency of the transaction on Xos'

business relationships, operating results, and business generally, (viii) risks that the proposed transaction disrupts current

plans and operations of Xos and potential difficulties in Xos employee retention as a result of the transaction, (ix) the outcome

of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Xos or against NextGen related to the Merger Agreement or the proposed

transaction, (x) the ability to maintain the listing of NextGen's securities on a national securities exchange, (xi) the

price of NextGen's securities may be volatile due to a variety of factors, including changes in the competitive and regulated

industries in which NextGen plans to operate or Xos operates, variations in operating performance across competitors, changes in

laws and regulations affecting NextGen's or Xos' business, Xos' inability to implement its business plan or meet

or exceed its financial projections and changes in the combined capital structure, (xii) the ability to implement business plans,

forecasts, and other expectations after the completion of the proposed transaction, and identify and realize additional opportunities,

and (xiii) the risk of downturns and a changing regulatory landscape in the highly competitive electric vehicle industry. The foregoing

list of factors is not exhaustive. You should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties described

in the ""Risk Factors"" section of NextGen's registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-248921), the registration

statement on Form S-4 discussed above, the proxy statement/prospectus and other documents filed or that may be filed by NextGen

from time to time with the SEC. These filings identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual

events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak

only as of the date they are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and Xos and NextGen

assume no obligation and do not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,

future events, or otherwise. Neither Xos nor NextGen gives any assurance that either Xos or NextGen, or the combined company, will

The maturity date of the Revolver is February 29, 2027. The Revolver allows for borrowings at a defined base rate, or at the one, three or six month Secured Overnight Finance Rate, also known as ""SOFR"", plus a defined margin.  If we prepay SOFR borrowings before their contractual maturity, we have agreed to compensate the bank for lost margin, as defined in the Revolver agreement. We are required to quarterly pay a 20-basis point fee on the unused portion of the Revolver. The Revolver is an amendment and restatement of our $16 million asset backed line of credit agreement with Bank of America which, as amended, was to expire on June 15, 2025.

No termination penalties were incurred by the Company in connection with the replacement of the asset backed line of credit agreement with the Revolver.

The Revolver requires us to not exceed 2.5 times leverage ratio and requires us to maintain at least a 1.25 times minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, both of which are defined in the Revolver agreement. There are no subjective acceleration clauses under the Revolver that would accelerate the maturity of our outstanding borrowings.

On February 6, 2019, Spire Inc. entered into an equity distribution agreement with RBC Capital Markets, LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &

Smith Incorporated (collectively, the Managers) and, as applicable, the relevant Forward Purchasers (as defined below), pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to

$150,000,000 from time to time through, at our discretion, any of the Managers as our sales agents or, if applicable, as Forward Sellers (as defined below) or acting as principals.

The sales, if any, of our common stock made under the equity distribution agreement through any Manager, as our sales agent or as a Forward Seller, will be

made by means of ordinary brokers transactions at market prices, in negotiated transactions or in transactions that are deemed to be  at-the-market

offerings as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act), including sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange, in block transactions or by any other method permitted by law, at

prices related to the prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices subject to certain minimum prices. Sales under the program will not commence until the satisfaction of certain conditions, including delivery to the Managers of legal opinions

and a comfort letter, which is not expected to occur until after the end of our current fiscal quarter, at the earliest.    We also may sell shares of our

common stock to each of the Managers, as principal for its own account, at a price to be agreed upon at the time of sale. If we sell shares of our common stock to a Manager, as principal, we will enter into a separate terms agreement with such

Manager, and we will describe the terms agreement in a separate prospectus supplement or pricing supplement.    The equity distribution agreement

contemplates that, in addition to the issuance and sale by us of shares of our common stock to or through the Managers as our sales agents, we may enter into forward sale transactions under separate forward sales confirmations and related pricing

supplements between us and such sales agent acting as agent for the forward purchaser affiliated therewith. These forward purchasers will be Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of America, N.A. (in such capacity, each, a Forward Purchaser and,

collectively, the Forward Purchasers). If we enter into a forward sale transaction with any Forward Purchaser, we expect that such Forward Purchaser, acting in accordance with the forward sales confirmation related to such forward sale

transaction, will attempt to borrow and sell, through the relevant Manager, acting as agent for such Forward Purchaser, shares of our common stock to hedge such Forward Purchasers exposure under such forward sale agreement. We refer to a

Manager, when acting as sales agent for the relevant Forward Purchaser, as, individually, a Forward Seller and, collectively, the Forward Sellers. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires,

references herein to the related or relevant Forward Purchaser mean, with respect to any Agent, the affiliate of such Agent that is acting as Forward Purchaser.

We will not initially receive any proceeds from any sale of borrowed shares of our common stock by or on behalf of a Forward Purchaser in connection with a

forward sale transaction as a hedge of such forward sale transaction. In the event of full physical settlement of a forward sale transaction, which we expect to occur on or prior to the maturity date of such forward sale transaction, we expect to

receive aggregate cash proceeds equal to the product of the forward sale price under such forward sale transaction and the number of shares of our common stock underlying such forward sale transaction, subject to the price adjustment and other

provisions of such forward sale transaction. If, however, we elect to cash settle or net share settle any forward sale transaction, we would expect to receive an amount of proceeds that is significantly lower than the product set forth in the

preceding sentence (in the case of any cash settlement) or will not receive any proceeds (in the case of any net share settlement), and we may owe cash (in the case of any cash settlement) or shares of our common stock (in the case of any net share

settlement) to the relevant Forward Purchaser.    In no event will the aggregate gross sales price of shares of our common stock sold by us to or through

the Managers, acting as our sales agents or as principals, and by the Forward Purchasers through the Forward Sellers, exceed $150,000,000.

We will pay each of the Managers acting as our sales agent a commission that will not exceed, but may be

lower than, 2.0% of the gross sales price per share of shares sold through it as our agent under the equity distribution agreement. The compensation to each Manager acting as a Forward Seller will be a mutually agreed commission in the form of a

reduction to the initial forward price under the related forward sale agreement that will not exceed, but may be lower than, 2.0% of the gross sales price of the borrowed shares sold through such Agent, acting as Forward Seller, during the

applicable forward hedge selling period for such shares (which gross sales price will be adjusted for daily accruals based on a floating interest rate and specified amounts related to expected dividends on shares of our common stock if an  ex-dividend  date occurs during such forward hedge selling period).    The above summary is qualified in its

entirety by reference to the equity distribution agreement (which includes as an exhibit thereto the form of forward sale confirmation) attached as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form  8-K  and is

incorporated herein by reference.    The shares of our common stock to be sold under the equity distribution agreement will be issued pursuant to an

effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 23, 2016 (Registration  No. 333-213759),  including the prospectus contained therein, as

supplemented by a prospectus supplement, dated February 6, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act.

On January 5, 2006, Dynasil Corporation of America

(""Registrant"" or ""Dynasil""), entered into two Business Loan

Agreements with Susquehanna Patriot Bank (""Susquehanna"")

pursuant to which Dynasil (a) entered into a $449,345.58

principal amount term loan (the ""term loan"") and (b) a

$200,000.00 principal amount line of credit facility (the

""line of credit""). Proceeds of the term loan were used to

repay and refinance Dynasil's previous mortgage loan with

Premier Bank and proceeds of the line of credit will be used

for general corporate purposes. The two Business Loan

Agreements were entered into at arms-length between Dynasil

and Susquehanna on terms and conditions, including without

limitation, acceleration rights, events of default,

Susquehanna's rights and remedies and similar provisions

that Dynasil believes are customary for loans of this sort.

In connection with the execution and delivery of the

Business Loan Agreements, Dynasil also executed and

delivered to Susquehanna customary forms of promissory

notes, mortgages, security agreements and similar related

documents.

The term loan provides for repayment over a 10 year

period at a fixed annual interest rate of 7.25% for the

first 5 years, reset to a fixed annual interest rate of 300

basis points over the rate of United States Treasury

Securities at the time of reset, with principal amortization

over a 20 year period. The term loan is secured by (a) a

first mortgage on Dynasil's New Jersey real estate and (b) a

first lien on Dynasil's New Jersey operating assets.

The line of credit is repayable on demand and carries

an annual interest rate of one-half percent over the

reported prime commercial rate of interest. It is secured by

a second mortgage on Dynasil's New Jersey real estate and a

third lien on Dynasil's New Jersey operating assets.

Citizens Bank of Massachusetts (""Citizens"") has lent

funds to Dynasil's wholly-owned subsidiary, Optometrics

Corporation (""Optometrics""). Dynasil has guaranteed those

loans and the guarantees are collateralized, in part, by the

stock of Optometrics and a second lien position on Dynasil's

New Jersey operating assets. Citizens has agreed to

subordinate its second lien position to permit the

Susquehanna loan facilities to be put into place.

Susquehanna has agreed to modify the standard terms and

conditions of its Business Loan Agreement form to take

account of and not conflict with the terms and provisions of

the Citizens loans to Optometrics, Dynasil's guarantees of

those loans and the dividend payment requirements of

Dynasil's outstanding shares of preferred stock.

Each credit facility is for a term of five years, but Group or Gas, as applicable, may request up to three one-year extensions of its respective credit facility.  Each agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for such agreements, including, among other things, limitations on certain types of acquisitions, investments, and sales of property.  Each agreement also contains financial covenants limiting consolidated debt to 70% of the respective company's consolidated capitalization.  The calculation is more specifically described in each of the agreements.  Each agreement also contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, payment defaults, covenant defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, cross defaults to certain other agreements, and the entry of certain judgments not appealed or satisfied.

On June

4, 2009, The Student Loan Corporation (the Company) received its initial funding

from the placement of Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans under

the U.S. Department of Education sponsored conduit, Straight-A Funding, LLC (the

Conduit).  The funding transaction settled today in the amount of $3.8

billion. Approximately $7 billion of the Company's FFEL Program loan portfolio

remains eligible for future funding under the Conduit.

The

Conduit provides additional liquidity support to the Company via the creation of

a multi-seller asset-backed commercial paper conduit that purchases

Stafford/PLUS loans first disbursed on or after October 1, 2003 and before July

1, 2009. Purchases of loans from lenders are funded indirectly through the

sale of asset-backed commercial paper to private investors.  The

Conduit is supported by a liquidity facility provided by the Federal Financing

Bank and an agreement with the U.S. Department of Education to purchase loans

from the Conduit in order to allow the Conduit to repay funds borrowed from the

Federal Financing Bank, to the extent required.  The Company expects

this facility to provide an attractively priced alternative source of funding,

which will be largely based on pricing the Conduit receives from the issuance of

asset-backed commercial paper.  The initial term of this funding is

five years.

On May 1, 2019, the Board of Directors

(the ""Board"") of Dynasil Corporation of America, a Delaware corporation (the ""Company""), upon the

recommendation of the Special Committee of the Board consisting of independent directors, approved a transaction whereby the Company

would effect a reverse/forward stock split of the Company's shares of common stock, in conjunction with terminating the Company's

public company reporting obligations and delisting the Company's common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market, subject to

obtaining the requisite approval of the Company's stockholders at a Special Meeting of Stockholders to be held for that purpose,

which is currently expected to occur in the summer of 2019.

Specifically, the Board recommended

and approved a transaction whereby the Company would effect a 1-for-8,000 reverse stock split of the Company's common stock

(the ""Reverse Stock Split""), followed immediately by a 8,000-for-1 forward stock split of the Company's common

stock (the ""Forward Stock Split,"" and together with the Reverse Stock Split, the ""Transaction""). Stockholders

owning fewer than 8,000 shares of common stock at the effective time of the Transaction would receive $1.15 in cash, without interest,

for each share of common stock held by them at the effective time of the Transaction, and thereafter they would no longer be stockholders

of the Company. Stockholders owning 8,000 or more shares at the effective time of the Transaction (""Continuing Stockholders"")

would not be entitled to receive any cash for their fractional share interests resulting from the Transaction, if any. The Forward

Stock Split, which would immediately follow the Reverse Stock Split, would reconvert whole shares and fractional share interests

held by the Continuing Stockholders back into the same number of shares of the Company's common stock held by such Continuing

Stockholders immediately before the effective time of the Transaction. As a result of the Forward Stock Split, the total number

of shares of the Company's common stock held by a Continuing Stockholder would not change as a result of the Transaction.

The Company estimates that approximately 1.4 million shares of the Company's common stock (or less than 8% of the shares

of common stock currently outstanding) would be cashed out in the Transaction and the aggregate cost to the Company of the Transaction

would be approximately $1.6 million, plus transaction expenses, which are estimated to be approximately $650,000. The Company expects

to fund such costs using cash-on-hand and borrowings available under its existing credit facilities.

The Transaction will be submitted to

a vote of the Company's stockholders at a Special Meeting of Stockholders to be called for that purpose. The Board has instructed

the Company's management to prepare and file a preliminary proxy statement with respect to the Transaction. Approval of the

Transaction requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares cast (represented in person or by proxy) and entitled to

vote at the Special Meeting of Stockholders. As of May 1, 2019, the Company's directors and executive officers owned approximately

37% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company's common stock and are expected to vote ""FOR"" the transaction.

The terms and contemplated timeline of the Transaction, including the manner of determining the fair value for fractional share

interests to be cashed out in the Transaction, will be set forth in the preliminary proxy statement and a transaction statement

on Schedule 13E-3 filed by the Company outlining the Transaction. The Transaction may be considered a ""going private""

transaction as defined in Rule 13e-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""),

as it is part of a plan to terminate the registration of (or ""deregister"") the Company's common stock under Section

12(g) of the Exchange Act and suspend the Company's duty to file periodic reports and other information with the SEC under

Section 13(a) thereunder, and to delist the Company's common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market.

If consummated, the Reverse Stock Split

and Forward Stock Split would apply directly only to record holders of the Company's common stock. Persons who hold shares

of the Company's common stock in ""street name"" are encouraged to contact their bank, broker or other nominee

for information on how the Transaction may affect any shares of the Company's common stock held for their account.

The Board may abandon the Transaction

at any time prior to the filing and effectiveness of the applicable amendments to the Company's certificate of incorporation,

even after stockholder approval, if the Board determines in its business judgment that the Transaction is no longer in the best

interests of the Company or its stockholders.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Marriott will acquire the Company in a series of transactions and stockholders of the Company will receive  0.920 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Marriott (the ""Stock Consideration""), and $2.00 in cash, without interest (the ""Cash Consideration"" and, together with the Stock Consideration, the ""Merger Consideration"").

The transaction will occur through multiple steps.  First, Starwood Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the ""Starwood Merger""), with the Company as the surviving entity (the ""Initial Starwood Surviving Corporation""). At the effective time of the Starwood Merger, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the ""Company Common Stock"") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Starwood Merger will be converted into the right to receive one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Holdco (the ""Holdco Common Stock"").

Immediately following the effectiveness of the Starwood Merger, the Initial Starwood Surviving Corporation will be converted from a Maryland corporation into a Maryland limited liability company (the ""Starwood LLC Conversion"").  Then, on the day immediately following the effectiveness of the Starwood Merger and the Starwood LLC Conversion, Marriott Corporate Merger Sub will be merged with and into Holdco (the ""Initial Holdco Merger""), with Holdco as the surviving entity in the Initial Holdco Merger (the ""Initial Holdco Surviving Corporation""). At the effective time of the Initial Holdco Merger, each share of Holdco Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

Finally, immediately following the effectiveness of the Initial Holdco Merger, the Initial Holdco Surviving Corporation will be merged with and into Marriott LLC Merger Sub (the ""Final Holdco Merger"" and, together with the Starwood Merger, the Starwood LLC Conversion and the Initial Holdco Merger, the ""Combination Transactions""), with Marriott LLC Merger Sub as the surviving entity in the Final Holdco Merger.

Consummation of the Combination Transactions  is subject to customary conditions, including customary conditions relating to (i) the approval of the Starwood Merger and the Initial Holdco Merger by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote thereon at a duly convened meeting (the ""Company Stockholder Approval""), (ii) the approval of the issuance of the Stock Consideration by Marriott by a majority of the votes cast at a duly convened meeting of the stockholders of Marriott (the ""Marriott Stockholder Approval""), (iii) the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended,  and receipt of other required regulatory approvals and (iv) the completion of the previously announced separation of the Company's vacation ownership business . The obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is also conditioned upon the other party's representations and warranties being true and correct (subject to certain materiality exceptions) and the other party having performed in all material respects its obligations under the Merger Agreement.

The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the Company and Marriott. Additionally, the Merger Agreement contains customary pre-closing covenants, including covenants requiring each party (i) to use reasonable best efforts to cause the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) to conduct its business in the ordinary course and (iii) to refrain from taking certain actions prior to the consummation of the Combination Transactions without the other party's consent.

California Police Department Offender

Tracking

Contract

On

September 7, 2007 RemoteMDx, Inc. (the ""Registrant"") announced that its

subsidiary, SecureAlert, Inc. (""SecureAlert""), had secured a contract with the

City of Fresno, California Police Department (""Fresno"") for the provision of

offender tracking services.  Fresno is implementing a comprehensive

program of controlling crime in its community by electronically monitoring

offenders.  Fresno has chosen SecureAlert to be its preferred vendor

in tracking and rehabilitating these offenders.  They have focused

their efforts in four specific areas:  gang violence, juvenile

offenders, sex predators and domestic violence.  Since each of these

four areas have their own distinctive characteristics, each area will commence

with a pilot that will work through the procedures and protocols of the program

followed by a major roll out in each area.  After the completion of

the pilot program, the project expects to be expanded to include in excess

of

2,500 offenders and could generate over $6 million per year in revenues to

SecureAlert.

SecureAlert

offers a unique combination of a 24 hour, seven-day-a-week monitoring center

that incorporates patented technology that combines GPS global positioning

which

locates offenders wherever they may be, two-way voice communications, and

application-specific software, all packaged in one compact, tamper-resistant

device worn by the offender.  SecureAlert offers to agencies a turnkey

service including equipment, real-time monitoring and training.  The

responsible enforcement agency is able to direct SecureAlert's monitoring center

to establish parameters of movement by offenders or known predators and any

breach in the pre-established rules by each offender triggers an

alarm.  At any time, day or night, professionally trained agents of

SecureAlert, Inc. are able to communicate in real time with the offender

through

the device's built-in interactions capability.  Additionally, agents

are able to summon police if necessary.

Since

January of 2007 nearly 200 law enforcement agencies throughout the United

States

have contracted with SecureAlert for its product and

services.  Currently SecureAlert has in excess of 8,000 units that

have either been sold or leased pursuant to its monitoring service.

TEM 3.02         UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

         On July 30, 2008,  the Registrant  entered into an Amendment  Agreement
(""Amendment Agreement"") to the Securities Purchase Agreement dated March 5, 2008
(the  ""Securities  Purchase  Agreement"")  with Gemini  Master  Fund,  Ltd.  (the
""Investor"").  The Registrant  previously  issued a  thirty-month  senior secured
convertible  note in the principal  amount of $2,000,000 (the ""Existing  Note""),
and a  five-year  warrant to  purchase  an  aggregate  of 875,000  shares of the
Registrant's common stock (the ""Existing Warrant"") under the Securities Purchase
Agreement.  Under the terms of the Amendment  Agreement,  the Registrant and the
Investor agreed, in exchange for the Investor's waiver of certain breaches under
the Existing  Note, to exchange the Existing Note for an amended and restated 8%
senior secured  convertible note (""Amended and Restated Note""),  and to exchange
the Existing Warrant for an amended and restated warrant  (""Amended and Restated
Warrant"").  The transactions  contemplated by the Amendment  Agreement closed on
August 12, 2008.

         The Amended and  Restated  Note has an  aggregate  principal  amount of
$2,500,000 and a term of  approximately  thirty months  commencing from March 5,
2008.  The Amended and  Restated  Note  carries  interest at 8% per annum on the
unpaid/unconverted  principal balance, and is secured on a second priority basis
against all of the assets of the Registrant.  One-twenty-fourth of the principal
amount of the Amended and Restated  Note, and accrued but unpaid  interest,  are
due and payable monthly in 24 installments  beginning on October 1, 2008.  These
installment  payments  can be made in cash or  through  the  issuance  of  stock
provided that certain equity conditions (as further set forth in the Amended and
Restated  Note) are met. The Amended and Restated  Note is  convertible,  at the
option of the  Investor  prior to its  maturity,  into  approximately  6,250,000
shares of the  Registrant's  common stock  (subject to adjustment as provided in
the Amended and  Restated  Note,  including  pursuant to economic  anti-dilution
adjustments),   based  on  a   conversion   price  equal  to  $0.40  per  share.
Additionally,  beginning  March 5, 2009, the Registrant can require the Investor
to convert the Amended and Restated Note into shares of the Registrant's  common
stock if the  volume-weighted  average  price  (as  determined  pursuant  to the
Amended and Restated  Note) of the common stock for any 20 out of 30 consecutive
trading days exceeds $0.80 and certain  equity  conditions (as further set forth
in the Amended and Restated Note) are met.

         The Amended and  Restated  Warrant has a term of five years  commencing
from March 5, 2008 and entitles the Investor to initially  purchase an aggregate
of 2,187,500 shares of the  Registrant's  common stock (subject to adjustment as
provided in the Amended and  Restated  Warrant,  including  pursuant to economic
anti-dilution adjustments) at an exercise price of $0.40 per share.

         The Amended and  Restated  Note and the  Amended and  Restated  Warrant
provide  that if the  Registrant  has not  obtained  shareholder  approval,  the
Registrant  may not issue,  upon  conversion  or  exercise  of the  Amended  and
Restated Note and the Amended and Restated Warrant,  as applicable,  a number of
shares of the Registrant's  common stock which,  when aggregated with any shares
of the  Registrant's  common stock issued on or after March 5, 2008 and prior to
expiration  of the Amended and Restated  Warrant and the maturity of the Amended
and  Restated  Note (A) in  connection  with the  conversion  of the Amended and
Restated Note or as payment of principal, interest or liquidated damages, (B) in


                                       2

connection  with the  exercise of the Amended and Restated  Warrant,  and (C) in
connection with any warrants issued to any registered  broker-dealer as a fee in
connection  with the  issuance  of the  securities  pursuant  to the  Securities
Purchase  Agreement,  would  exceed  19.99%  of  the  number  of  shares  of the
Registrant's common stock outstanding on March 4, 2008.

         On July 30,  2008,  the  Registrant  obtained  the  written  consent of
holders of a majority  of the  outstanding  shares of the  Registrant's  capital
stock to the transactions contemplated under the Amendment Agreement and intends
to file an information  statement to effectuate the actions  approved therein in
the immediate future.

         The Amended and Restated Note and the Amended and Restated Warrant also
reduced to $0.30 the minimum trading price for the Registrant's  common stock in
connection  with  revisions to one of the equity  conditions  included  therein.
Except for the provisions described above, the terms of the Amended and Restated
Note and Amended and Restated Warrant are the same as those of the Existing Note
and Existing Warrant, respectively.

         Also in connection with the Amendment Agreement, the Registrant and its
previously engaged placement agent agreed, in exchange for the placement agent's
waiver of certain  breaches  under the original note in the principal  amount of
$86,400 issued to the placement agent (the ""Agent Note""),  to exchange the Agent
Note for an amended and  restated 8% senior  convertible  note in the  principal
amount of $108,000  (convertible into 270,000 shares of the Registrant's  common
stock at a per share  price of $0.40)  with terms  substantially  similar to the
Amended and  Restated  Note (other than the grant of a security  interest)  (the
""Amended  and  Restated  Agent  Note""),  and to exchange the warrant to purchase
150,000  shares  of the  Registrant's  common  stock  originally  issued  to the
placement   agent,  for  a  new  warrant  to  purchase  244,500  shares  of  the
Registrant's common stock, with terms  substantially  similar to the Amended and
Restated Warrant (the ""Amended and Restated Agent Warrant"").

         The issuance of the Amended and Restated Note, the Amended and Restated
Warrant,  the Amended and Restated Agent Note and the Amended and Restated Agent
Warrant is intended  to be exempt from  registration  under the  Securities  Act
pursuant to Section  3(a)(9)  thereof,  as such securities were exchanged by the
Registrant with existing security holders exclusively and no commission or other
remuneration  was paid or given  directly  or  indirectly  for  soliciting  such
exchange.  No registration  statement  covering these  securities has been filed
with  the  SEC or  with  any  state  securities  commission  in  respect  of the
transactions contemplated by the Amendment Agreement.

         The transaction documents,  including the Amendment Agreement and forms
of Amended and Restated Note and Amended and Restated Warrant,  were attached to
the Registrant's Current Report on Form 8-K (File No. 000-33297), filed with the

information included in Item 3.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is also incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03 of

this Current Report on Form 8-K to the extent required. On May 29, 2015, Sino Mercury Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) issued a $300,000 convertible promissory note to Jianming Hao, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (the “Lender”), to evidence a loan made by the Lender to the Company. The loan is unsecured, non-interest bearing and is payable at the consummation by the Company of a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, or other similar business combination, with one or more businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”). Upon consummation of a Business Combination, the principal balance of the note may be converted, at the holder’s option, to units at a price of $10.00 per unit. The terms of the units will be identical to the units issued by the Company in its initial public offering.

Total return is calculated as the change in net asset value (""NAV"") per share (assuming dividends and distributions, if any, are reinvested in accordance with the Company's dividend reinvestment plan), if any, divided by the beginning NAV per share (which for the purposes of this calculation is equal to the net offering price in effect at that time).

Past performance does not guarantee future

results. Returns reflect reinvestment of distributions and the deduction of ongoing expenses that are borne by investors, such

as management fees, incentive fees, interest expense, offering costs, professional fees, director fees and other general and administrative

expenses. An investment in the Company is subject to a maximum upfront sales load of 5% of the offering price, which will reduce

the amount of capital available for investment. Operating expenses may vary in the future based on the amount of capital raised,

the Adviser's election to continue expense support, and other unpredictable variables.

of 10,909,091 common shares (the "" Underwritten Shares "") of the Company, no par value per share (the "" Common

Shares ""), and accompanying common warrants to purchase up to 10,909,091 Common Shares (the "" Underwritten Warrants ""),

"          On July 22, 2022, Spire Inc. (""Spire""), Spire Missouri Inc. (""Spire Missouri"") and Spire Alabama Inc. (""Spire Alabama"" and, together with Spire and Spire Missouri, each, a ""Borrower"" and, collectively, the ""Borrowers"") entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement among the Borrowers, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto as Banks (the ""Loan Agreement""). The Loan Agreement amends, restates and replaces the Loan and Security Agreement dated as of December 14, 2016 among the Borrowers, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, as amended by a First Amendment to Loan Agreement dated as of October 31, 2018.    Each Borrower and its affiliates has or may have customary banking relationships with one or more of the banks under the Loan Agreement for the provision of a variety of financial services, including commercial paper dealer, pension fund trustee, cash management, investment banking, and lockbox services, none of which are material individually or in the aggregate with respect to any individual party.    The Loan Agreement has an aggregate credit commitment of $1.3 billion, including sublimits of $450 million for Spire, $575 million for Spire Missouri, and $275 million for Spire Alabama. These sublimits may be reallocated from time to time among the three Borrowers within the $1.3 billion aggregate commitment. In certain situations, the Borrowers may request an increase in the aggregate revolving credit commitment of up to $300 million (to a total of $1.6 billion). The Loan Agreement also provides for letters of credit available to the Borrowers in an aggregate amount up to $50 million and swingline loans in an aggregate amount up to $100 million. Letters of credit and swingline loans are sublines of credit under the Loan Agreement and count against the total commitment amount available. Each Borrower expects to use the Loan Agreement for general corporate purposes, including short-term borrowings and letters of credit. Loans or other credit extensions under the Loan Agreement to a Borrower constitute obligations of only that Borrower, and do not constitute obligations of the other Borrowers.    The Loan Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for such agreements, including, among other things, limitations on certain types of acquisitions, investments, and sales of property. The Loan Agreement also contains financial covenants limiting each Borrower's consolidated debt to 70% of such Borrower's capitalization. The calculation is more specifically described in the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, payment defaults, covenant defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, cross defaults to certain other agreements, and the entry of certain judgments not appealed or satisfied.    Under the Loan Agreement, revolving credit borrowings will bear interest at either an adjusted base rate or an adjusted term SOFR rate, at each Borrower's option, plus, in either case, an applicable margin. The base rate is the highest of Wells Fargo Bank's prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, or an adjusted term SOFR rate for a tenor of one month plus 1%. The additional margin applicable to adjusted base rate loans varies between 0% and 0.5%, depending on the applicable Borrower's senior unsecured debt rating as determined by S&P, Fitch or Moody's. The adjusted term SOFR rate is the sum of term SOFR for an interest period of 1, 3 or 6 months, as the applicable Borrower may select, plus a SOFR adjustment spread of 0.1%. The additional margin applicable to adjusted term SOFR loans varies between 0.875% and 1.5%, depending on the applicable Borrower's senior unsecured debt rating as determined by S&P, Fitch or Moody's. Certain interest rates are subject to a floor of 0%.    Swingline loans bear interest, at the applicable Borrower's option, at either (a) an adjusted base rate plus an applicable margin (in each case as described above with respect to revolving credit loans) or (b) a daily floating interest rate equal to term SOFR for an interest period of one month, plus a term SOFR adjustment spread of 0.1%, plus an additional margin that varies between 0.875% and 1.5%, depending on the applicable Borrower's senior unsecured debt rating as determined by S&P, Fitch or Moody's.    The interest rate margin on revolving credit loans and swing line loans to Spire (but not to Spire Missouri or Spire Alabama) is subject to annual  ESG-based  sustainability adjustments. Depending on whether Spire achieves certain key performance indicator (KPI) metrics, the annual interest rate on revolving credit loans and swing line loans may increase or decrease by up to 5.0 basis points in any year.    Fees on letters of credit accrue at annual rate that varies between 0.875% and 1.5%, depending on the applicable Borrower's senior unsecured debt rating as determined by S&P, Fitch or Moody's. Other fees may also be charged by the bank that issues a letter of credit.                Revolving credit loan borrowings by Spire Missouri or Spire Alabama under the Loan Agreement are due within 364 days after being made.    Each Borrower has paid certain upfront fees to certain of the banks for the Loan Agreement and, during the term of the Loan Agreement, each Borrower will pay the banks a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit made available to it under the Loan Agreement. That fee varies between 0.075% and 0.225% depending on the applicable Borrower's senior unsecured debt rating, as determined by S&P, Fitch or Moody's. The commitment fee for Spire (but not Spire Missouri or Spire Alabama) is also subject to  ESG-based  sustainability adjustments. The fee may be increased or decreased up to 1.0 basis points in any year depending on whether Spire achieves certain KPI metrics.",TRUE

"       Purchase Agreement    On February 18, 2020, Tallgrass Energy Partners, LP (""TEP""), Tallgrass Energy Finance Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of TEP (the  ""Co-Issuer""  and together with TEP, the ""Issuers""), and certain of TEP's existing direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (other than the  Co-Issuer,  the ""Guarantors""), entered into a purchase agreement (the ""Purchase Agreement"") with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as representative of the several initial purchasers named therein (the ""Initial Purchasers""), pursuant to which the Issuers agreed to sell $430,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Issuers' 6.000% Senior Notes due 2027 (the ""Notes""), and the Guarantors agreed to provide the guarantees of the Notes. The Notes were offered and sold in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). The Notes were sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.    Tallgrass Energy, LP (""TGE"") is the managing member of Tallgrass Equity, LLC (""Tallgrass Equity"") and owns approximately 63.75% of the outstanding membership interests of Tallgrass Equity, as of February 12, 2020. TEP is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tallgrass Equity and its subsidiaries.    The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the parties and indemnification and contribution provisions under which the Issuers and the Guarantors, on one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other, have agreed to indemnify each other against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and customary conditions to closing, obligations of the parties and termination provisions.    The Initial Purchasers and certain of their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers and certain of their affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various commercial and investment banking and financial advisory services for TEP and its affiliates, for which they received or may in the future receive customary fees and expenses. In particular, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are agents and/or lenders under TEP's revolving credit facility. TEP used the net proceeds from the Notes to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under TEP's revolving credit facility, and therefore, affiliates of the Initial Purchasers received a portion of such proceeds.   In addition, as previously announced, on December 16, 2019, TGE and its general partner entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Take-Private Merger Agreement"") with Prairie Private Acquiror LP, a Delaware limited partnership (""Buyer""), and Prairie Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer. Pursuant to the Take-Private Merger Agreement and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions therein, Buyer will merger with and into TGE, with TGE surviving the merger and continuing to exist as a Delaware limited partnership (the ""Take-Private Merger""). Buyer is an affiliate of Blackstone Infrastructure Partners (""BIP""), and BIP effectively controls TGE's business and affairs through the exercise of the rights of TGE's general partner. Additionally, BIP's controlled affiliates collectively held an approximate 44.1% economic interest in TGE as of February 7, 2020.    In connection with the Take-Private Merger, certain affiliates of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Jefferies LLC and MUFG Securities Americas Inc. are acting as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners and an affiliate of Blackstone Advisory Partners L.P. is acting as a co-manager in connection with a term loan to an affiliate of the Buyer. Affiliates of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. are also acting as financial advisors to an affiliate of Buyer, for which such affiliates of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. are receiving a fee. Additionally, in connection with the Take-Private Merger, certain affiliates of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Blackstone Advisory Partners L.P., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Jefferies LLC and MUFG Securities Americas Inc. are party to a debt commitment letter with an affiliate of Buyer, pursuant to which the amount of debt financing such affiliates have agreed to provide will be reduced by the amount reborrowed under the TEP revolving credit facility to fund a portion of the consideration of the Take-Private Merger, and for which such affiliates will receive a fee. As such, Blackstone Advisory Partners L.P. is an affiliate of the Buyer and certain other affiliates of Blackstone Advisory Partners L.P. are party to the debt commitment letter and a co-manager for the term loan to Buyer.   The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Purchase Agreement, which is filed with this Current Report on Form  8-K  as Exhibit 1.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.    Indenture and Notes    On February 20, 2020, the Issuers, the Guarantors named therein and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, entered into an Indenture dated as of February 20, 2020 (the ""Indenture""), governing the terms of the Notes. The Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Issuers. The Notes are unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally on a

senior unsecured basis by the Guarantors and will be guaranteed by certain of TEP's future subsidiaries. The Notes rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuers, and senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Issuers. The Notes are effectively junior to any of TEP's secured indebtedness, including indebtedness under TEP's revolving credit facility, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, and are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of TEP's subsidiaries and other entities in which TEP owns an equity interest that do not guarantee the Notes.    Interest and Maturity    The Notes will mature on March 1, 2027 and interest on the Notes is payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on each March 1 and September 1, commencing September 1, 2020. Interest will be payable to holders of record on the February 15 and August 15 immediately preceding the related interest payment date, and will be computed on the basis of a  360-day  year consisting of twelve  30-day  months.    Optional Redemption    At any time prior to March 1, 2023, the Issuers may on one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes issued under the Indenture, upon not less than 30 or more than 60 days' notice, at a redemption price of 106.000% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date), in an amount not greater than the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings by TEP, provided that:

*

at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes issued under the Indenture (excluding Notes held by TEP and its subsidiaries) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption; and

*

the redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of each such equity offering.       Prior to March 1, 2023, the Issuers may redeem all or part of the Notes, upon not less than 30 or more than 60 days' notice, at a redemption price equal to the sum of:

*

the principal amount thereof, plus

*

the Make Whole Premium (as defined in the Indenture) at the redemption date, plus

accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date).       On and after March 1, 2023, the Issuers may redeem all or a part of the Notes, upon not less than 30 or more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes

redeemed to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on March 1 of the years indicated below:

Change of Control    If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, each holder of Notes may require TEP to repurchase all or a portion of that holder's Notes for cash at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus any accrued but unpaid interest on the notes repurchased, to, but excluding, the date of settlement (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the settlement date).    Certain Covenants    The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit TEP's ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to: (i) create liens to secure indebtedness; (ii) enter into sale-leaseback transactions; and (iii) consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of TEP's properties to, another person.    Events of Default    Upon a continuing event of default, the trustee or the holders of 25% of the principal amount of the Notes may declare the Notes immediately due and payable, except that a default resulting from a bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to TEP or any subsidiary of TEP that is a Significant Subsidiary (as defined in the Indenture) or any group of its subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary of TEP, will automatically cause all Notes to become due and payable. Each of the following constitutes an event of default under the Indenture:

*

default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the Notes;

*

default in payment when due of the principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

*

failure by TEP to comply with the covenant relating to consolidations, mergers or transfers of all or substantially all of TEP's assets or failure by TEP to purchase notes when required pursuant to the change of control provision of the Indenture;

*

failure by TEP for 180 days after notice to comply with its reporting obligations under the Indenture;

*

failure by TEP for 60 days after notice to comply with any of the other agreements in the Indenture;

*

default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument governing any indebtedness for money borrowed or guaranteed by TEP or any of its subsidiaries, if such default: (i) is caused by a failure to pay principal, interest or premium, if any, on said indebtedness within any applicable grace period; or (ii) results in the acceleration of such indebtedness prior to its stated maturity, and, in each case, the principal amount of the indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or acceleration of maturity, aggregates $100.0 million or more, subject to a cure provision;

*

failure by TEP or any of its subsidiaries to pay final non-appealeable judgments aggregating in excess of $100.0 million (to the extent not covered by insurance by certain insurers as to which the insurer has not disclaimed coverage), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days;

*

except as permitted by the Indenture, any guarantee is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid, or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or any Guarantor, or any person acting on behalf of any Guarantor, denies or disaffirms its obligations under its guarantee; and

*

The Escrowed Funds will be held in escrow pending satisfaction of the escrow release conditions in full pursuant to the terms of the SR Agreement (the Escrow Release Conditions), including but not limited to the Company completing the listing of its common shares on a recognized stock exchange in Canada. Upon satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions (the Escrow Release Date), the Escrowed Funds, after deducting certain finder's fees payable in connection with the Private Placement, will be released to the Company and each Subscription Receipt will be automatically converted without any further action on the part of the holder thereof into one SR Unit (as defined below).

The Finder's Warrants will be on the same terms as the SR Warrants as defined below.       Each SR Unit will consist of one common share of the Company (each a Share) and one common share purchase warrant (each a SR Warrant). Each SR Warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase an additional common share of the Company at a price of CAD$0.30 per common share, if exercised during the first year following the Escrow Release Date, and at a price of CAD$0.60, if exercised during the second year following the Escrow Release Date. Pursuant to the terms of the Private Placement, in the event that the Company does not meet the Escrow Release Conditions by September 30, 2021 (or such later date as may be agreed to by the Company), the escrow agent shall return to the holders of the Subscription Receipts an amount equal to the aggregate purchase price paid for the Subscription Receipts held by each holder, and each Subscription Receipt shall be cancelled and be of no further force or effect.

The initial weighted average life of each class of Notes has been calculated assuming that there are no prepayments, defaults or delinquencies and certain other modeling assumptions. In addition, it is assumed that each commercial real estate loan pays off on its current maturity date without extension. There can be no assurances that such assumptions will be met.

(2)

The fully extended weighted average life of each class of Notes has been calculated assuming that there are no prepayments, defaults or delinquencies and certain other modeling assumptions. In addition, it is assumed that each commercial real estate loan is fully extended to its maximum contracted extension term. There can be no assurances that such assumptions will be met.

The Notes will mature at par on the payment date in November 2036, unless redeemed or repaid prior thereto.    The Indenture allows for the exchange of all or a portion of certain classes of Notes for proportionate interests in one or more classes of certain other notes, as further explained under the heading "" Exchangeable Notes "" below.    The Offered Notes were placed pursuant to a Placement Agreement, dated as of October 21, 2021, by and among the Issuer, the  Co-Issuer,  the Company, the Seller, Barclays Capital Inc., Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. The Retention Holder, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of  Sub-REIT,  acquired 100% of the Class F Notes, the Class G Notes and the Preferred Shares issued on the CLO Closing Date.   The Offered Notes represent limited recourse obligations of the Issuer and  non-recourse  obligations of the  Co-Issuer  payable solely from certain collateral interests acquired by the Issuer on and after the CLO Closing Date and pledged under the Indenture. To the extent the collateral is insufficient to make payments in respect of the Offered Notes, none of the Issuer, the  Co-Issuer,  any of their respective affiliates or any other person will have any obligation to pay any further amounts in respect of the Offered Notes. The Class F Notes and the Class G Notes are not secured.    The Preferred Shares are subject to the terms and conditions of a Preferred Share Paying Agency Agreement, dated as of November 4, 2021, among the Issuer, Wells Fargo Bank, as paying agent and transfer agent, and MaplesFS Limited, as Preferred Share registrar. The Preferred Shares have no stated dividend rate. The holders of the Preferred Shares are entitled to receive monthly  non-cumulative  dividends on each payment date if and to the extent that funds are available for such purpose in accordance with the priority of payments and Cayman Islands law. Such dividends will be payable only to the extent of the Issuer's distributable profits and/or share premium and only if the Issuer is and will remain solvent after such distributions are paid (each factor determined in accordance with Cayman Islands law). In addition, the holders of the Preferred Shares will be entitled to receive distributions in connection with the redemption thereof, payable from the collateral after payment of all specified amounts in accordance with the priority of payments and Cayman Islands law.    The Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), or any state securities laws, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.    The proceeds from the issuance of the Securities on the CLO Closing Date, after payment of certain fees and expenses, were used to (i) purchase an initial portfolio of collateral interests, (ii) fund the unused proceeds account for the purchase of additional collateral interests, (iii) repay amounts owed in respect of certain  pre-CLO  Closing Date financings, including under certain repurchase facilities with affiliates of the Placement Agents, and (iv) undertake certain related activities.    The initial portfolio of collateral interests was purchased by the Issuer from FS CREIT Finance Holdings LLC (the ""Seller"") pursuant to a Collateral Interest Purchase Agreement (the ""Collateral Interest Purchase Agreement""), dated as of November 4, 2021, by and among the Issuer, the Seller, the Company and, solely with regard to certain tax covenants,  Sub-REIT.  Pursuant to the Collateral Interest Purchase Agreement, the Seller made certain representations and warranties to the Issuer with respect to the collateral interests. In the event that a material breach of a representation or warranty or document defect with respect to any collateral interest exists, the Seller will have to either (a) correct or cure such breach of representation or warranty or document defect in all material respects, within 90 days (or as such time may be extended under the Collateral Interest Purchase Agreement) of discovery by the Seller or any party to the Indenture (to the extent such breach is capable of being corrected or cured), (b) make a cash payment to the Issuer in an amount that the Special Servicer determines is sufficient to compensate the Issuer or (c) repurchase such collateral interest at a repurchase price calculated as set forth in the Collateral Interest Purchase Agreement. The obligation of the Seller to repurchase a collateral interest in connection with a material breach of a representation or warranty or a document defect pursuant to the Collateral Interest Purchase Agreement has been guaranteed by the Company.

The Notes    Collateral    The Offered Notes will be secured by, among other things, (i) the commercial mortgage loans and participation interests in commercial mortgage loans acquired by the Issuer on the CLO Closing Date and thereafter from time to time in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, (ii) the collection account, the participated loan collection account, the payment account, the unused proceeds account, the custodial account and the related security entitlements and all income from the investment of funds in any of the foregoing at any time credited to any of the foregoing accounts, (iii) the eligible investments purchased from deposits in certain accounts, (iv) the Issuer's rights under certain agreements (including the Collateral Management Agreement, the Collateral Interest Purchase Agreement and the Servicing Agreement, each as defined herein), (v) all amounts delivered to the Note Administrator or its bailee (directly or through a securities intermediary), (vi) all other investment property, instruments and general intangibles in which the Issuer has an interest, (vii) the Issuer's ownership interests in and rights in all permitted subsidiaries and (viii) all proceeds of the foregoing (collectively, the ""Collateral""); however, the Collateral will not include, and the Offered Notes will not be secured by, any interests in certain excepted property enumerated in the Indenture.    Maturity    The Notes will mature at par on the payment date in November 2036, unless redeemed or repaid prior thereto.    Interest Rate    For purposes of the below, ""Benchmark"" means, initially, LIBOR;  provided  that if a benchmark transition event and its related benchmark replacement date have occurred with respect to LIBOR or the then-current Benchmark, then ""Benchmark"" means the applicable benchmark replacement.    Class  A Notes . The Class A Notes will bear interest during each interest accrual period at a  per annum  rate equal to the sum of (a) the Benchmark plus (b)(i) with respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period), 1.25% plus (ii) with respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period) on and after the payment date in September 2026, 0.25%.    Class  A-S  Notes . The  Class A-S  Notes will bear interest during each interest accrual period at a  per annum  rate equal to the sum of (a) the Benchmark plus (b)(i) with respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period), 1.55% plus (ii) with respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period) on and after the payment date in September 2026, 0.25%.    Class  B Notes . The Class B Notes will bear interest during each interest accrual period at a  per annum  rate equal to the sum of (a) the Benchmark plus (b)(i) with respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period), 1.80% plus (ii) with respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period) on and after the payment date in September 2026, 0.50%.    Class  C Notes . The Class C Notes will bear interest during each interest accrual period at a  per annum  rate equal to the sum of (a) the Benchmark plus (b)(i) with respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period), 2.05% plus (ii) with respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period) on and after the payment date in September 2026, 0.50%.    Class  D Notes . The Class D Notes will bear interest during each interest accrual period at a  per annum  rate equal to the sum of (a) the Benchmark plus (b)(i) with respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period), 2.50% plus (ii) with respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period) on and after the payment date in October 2026, 0.50%.    Class  E Notes . The Class E Notes will bear interest during each interest accrual period at a  per annum  rate equal to the sum of (a) the Benchmark plus (b)(i) with respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period), 2.85% plus (ii) with respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period) on and after the payment date in October 2026, 0.50%.

Class  F Notes . The Class F Notes will bear interest during each interest accrual period at a  per annum  rate equal to the sum of (a) the Benchmark plus (b) with respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period), 4.50%.    Class  G Notes . The Class G Notes will bear interest during each interest accrual period at a  per annum  rate equal to the sum of (a) the Benchmark plus (b) with respect to each payment date (and related interest accrual period), 6.75%.    Interest on the Notes will be calculated based on the actual number of days in the related interest accrual period, assuming a  360-day  year.    The failure to pay interest on the Class A Notes, the  Class A-S  Notes or the Class B Notes at any time or, if no Class A Notes,  Class A-S  Notes or Class B Notes are outstanding, on any other class of Notes at the time such class of Notes is the most senior class of Notes outstanding, will constitute an event of default under the Indenture (following any applicable grace period).    For so long as any class of Notes with a higher priority is outstanding, any interest due on the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes, the Class E Notes, the Class F Notes and the Class G Notes that is not paid as a result of the operation of the priority of payments on any payment date (any such interest, ""Deferred Interest"") will be deferred, will not be considered ""due and payable"" and the failure to pay such Deferred Interest will not be an event of default under the Indenture. Any Deferred Interest will be added to the outstanding principal balance of such class of Notes.    Principal payments on each class of Notes will be paid in accordance with the priority of payments set forth in the Indenture.    Exchangeable Notes    The Indenture allows for the exchange of all or a portion of the Class F Notes and the Class G Notes, as follows: (i) the Class F Notes may be exchanged for proportionate interests in the  Class F-E  Notes and the  Class F-X  Notes and (ii) the Class G Notes may be exchanged for proportionate interests in the  Class G-E  Notes and the  Class G-X  Notes, in the manner set forth in the Indenture.    Subordination of the Notes    In general, payments of interest and principal on any class of Notes are subordinate to all payments of interest and principal on any class of Notes with a more senior priority. Generally, all payments on the Notes will be subordinate to certain payments required to be made in respect of any interest advances and certain other expenses. Payments on the Notes will be senior to any payments on or in respect of the Preferred Shares to the extent required by the priority of payments set forth in the Indenture.    Note Protection Tests    The Notes are subject to note protection tests (the ""Note Protection Tests""), which will be used primarily to determine whether and to what extent interest received on the collateral interests may be used to make certain payments subordinate to interest and principal payments to the Offered Notes in the priority of payments set forth in the Indenture.    If either of the Note Protection Tests are not satisfied as of any determination date, then on the next payment date, interest proceeds will be used to redeem the Offered Notes in accordance with the priority of payments until such Note Protection Tests are satisfied.

The following chart specifies the minimum ratios required for each Note Protection Test to be satisfied for the Notes.

The par value ratio is, as of any measurement date, the number (expressed as a percentage) calculated by dividing (a) the net outstanding portfolio balance on such measurement date by (b) the sum of the aggregate outstanding amount of the Class A Notes, the  Class A-S  Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D and the Class E Notes and the amount of any unreimbursed interest advances.    The interest coverage ratio is generally equal to the interest proceeds from the collateral portfolio divided by the interest payable on the Offered Notes.    Collateral Management Agreement    Pursuant to a Collateral Management Agreement, dated as of November 4, 2021, between the Issuer and the Company (the ""Collateral Management Agreement""), the Company will serve as collateral manager for the CLO Issuers. The Collateral Manager is externally managed by, and has delegated its investment management activities to, the Advisor pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of an advisory agreement between the Company and the Advisor. The Advisor has engaged Rialto Capital Management, LLC, an affiliate of the Special Servicer, to act as its  sub-advisor.     As compensation for the performance of its obligations as Collateral Manager, the Collateral Manager is entitled to receive a fee, payable monthly in arrears, equal to (unless waived) 0.10%  per annum  of the sum of the net outstanding portfolio balance to the extent funds are available. The Company has agreed to waive its entitlement to such Collateral Manager fee for so long as the Company or an affiliate is the Collateral Manager.    The Collateral Manager may be removed upon at least 30 days' prior written notice by the Issuer or the Trustee, if (i) certain events of default have occurred by the Collateral Manager and (ii) if the holders of at  least 66-2/3% in  aggregate outstanding amount of each class of Notes then outstanding give written notice to the Collateral Manager, the Issuer and the Trustee directing such removal. The Collateral Manager cannot be removed without cause but may resign as Collateral Manager upon 90 days' prior written notice. Upon any resignation or removal of the Collateral Manager while any of the Notes are outstanding, holders of a majority of the Preferred Shares (excluding any Preferred Shares held by certain related parties) will have the right to instruct the Issuer to appoint an institution identified by such holders as replacement Collateral Manager. In the event that (i) 100% of the aggregate outstanding Preferred Shares are held by related parties, (ii) the proposed replacement Collateral Manager is an affiliate of the Collateral Manager, and (iii) the appointment of the proposed replacement Collateral Manager would constitute an ""assignment"" under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the holders of at least a majority of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the most junior class of Notes not 100% owned by related parties (excluding any Notes held by related parties to the extent the replacement Collateral Manager is an affiliate of the Collateral Manager or the Collateral Manager has been removed after the occurrence of an event of default) may direct the Issuer to appoint an institution identified by such holders as replacement Collateral Manager.    Except with respect to the limitations set forth in the Indenture, the Collateral Manager is not obligated to pursue any particular investment strategy or opportunity with respect to the collateral interests.    Reinvestment Period    The CLO includes a  24-month reinvestment  period (unless all of the Notes are redeemed or an event of default occurs before such date). During such period, the Issuer may acquire additional (a) commercial mortgage loans or (b) participation interests in commercial mortgage loans.

The Servicing Agreement    Except for  certain non-serviced loans,  the commercial real estate loans will be serviced by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as servicer (the ""Servicer""), and Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC, as special servicer (the ""Special Servicer""), pursuant to a Servicing Agreement (the ""Servicing Agreement""), dated as of November 4, 2021, by and among the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Advancing Agent, the Trustee and the Note Administrator.    The Servicing Agreement requires each of the Servicer and the Special Servicer to diligently service and administer the commercial real estate loans (other than  certain non-serviced loans)  and any applicable mortgaged property acquired directly or indirectly by the Special Servicer for the benefit of the secured parties under the Indenture. In connection with their respective duties under the Servicing Agreement, the Servicer and the Special Servicer (or any replacement servicer or special servicer) are entitled to monthly servicing and special servicing fees, as described in the Servicing Agreement.    The Issuer is a Taxable Mortgage Pool    The Issuer is a ""taxable mortgage pool"" (""TMP"") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Internal Revenue Code""). So long as the Issuer is wholly-owned by  Sub-REIT  and  Sub-REIT  remains qualified as a real estate investment trust (""REIT"") under the Internal Revenue Code, the Issuer is expected to be treated as a ""qualified REIT subsidiary"" that is generally treated as part of  Sub-REIT  rather than as a fully taxable C corporation, which is the general treatment of a TMP that is not a wholly-owned subsidiary of a REIT.    However, ""excess inclusion income"" (""EII"") attributable to a TMP, if distributed to the stockholders of a REIT, is taxable in all events to those stockholders regardless of the general tax characteristics of, and any tax attributes (such as net operating losses) otherwise available to, such stockholders. For example, EII would be unrelated business taxable income if it were distributed as dividends to stockholders of the Company that are otherwise generally exempt from U.S. federal income tax. The Company does not intend to distribute EII to its stockholders, but to instead pay (or cause to be paid) corporate income tax on such EII as and when it arises. Although the Company does not expect that the amount of any such corporate income tax will be material, there are various uncertainties concerning the correct computation of EII, which are to be based on regulations that have not yet been issued. These uncertainties could increase the amount of EII taxable to the Company or  Sub-REIT  above the amount the Company anticipates, could result in a portion of the dividends distributed to stockholders being treated as EII, or both.    In addition, if the Issuer ceased to be a ""qualified REIT subsidiary"", that would, subject to certain exceptions, generally be an event of default under the Indenture. In order for the Issuer to remain a ""qualified REIT subsidiary"" under the Internal Revenue Code, it must remain wholly-owned at all times by  Sub-REIT  or by another REIT. This generally will require  Sub-REIT  to retain not only all the equity in the Issuer, but also all of those classes of Notes as to which counsel to the Company is unable to render an opinion that they will be treated as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes if they are sold to another party. Such restrictions on transfer will restrict the liquidity of the equity in the Issuer and of the Class F Notes and the Class G Notes, and indirectly the assets that secure the Notes, and could prevent the Company and  Sub-REIT  from transferring all or part of those positions in circumstances in which it would otherwise do so.",TRUE

"    Introduction

Santander Holdings USA, Inc. (the Company) is a financial services holding company in the U.S. with $123.2 billion in assets as of March 31,

2015. Based in Boston, Massachusetts, the Company offers a full range of consumer and commercial banking products and services. The Company has developed stress testing processes that capture its unique mix of businesses, risks and geographic

footprint.    Dodd-Frank Stress Test Requirements    In

October 2012, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve) issued a final rule on supervisory and company-run stress test requirements for bank holding companies (BHCs) with total consolidated

assets of $50 billion or more which requires the Company to conduct mid-cycle company-run stress tests under baseline, adverse and severely adverse economic scenarios.

The rule, as amended on October 27, 2014, requires the Company to disclose publicly the results of its stress tests under the internally- developed

severely adverse stress scenario. The Company is further required to employ the following assumptions (the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing Capital Actions) regarding its projected capital actions over the forecast horizon (nine quarters,

beginning March 31, 2015 and ending June 30, 2017):

Payment of common stock dividends equal to the quarterly average dollar amount of common stock dividends paid in the previous year. The Company assumed no common stock dividends;

Payments on any other instrument eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio equal to the stated dividend, interest or principal due on such instrument; and

No redemption or repurchase of any capital instrument eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio. The Companys forecast does not include the repurchase of Santander Consumer USA Holdings

Inc. common stock from its former Chief Executive Officer as disclosed on July 2, 2015.    Macroeconomic Scenario and Severity

The Company developed a severely adverse scenario that is in line with a protracted deflationary recession, including a sharp contraction in gross

domestic product (GDP) and elevated unemployment rates. National and regional macroeconomic factors have been modified and tailored to stress the Companys geographic footprint, unique risk profile and strategic plans. These

modifications include severe declines in used vehicle values, commercial real estate prices and home prices in the Companys footprint.    In addition

to the macroeconomic downturn, multiple idiosyncratic risk events were layered into the scenario to target the Companys unique risk profile in areas that may not be directly impacted by changes to macroeconomic indicators.

The Company designed the hypothetical scenario to be significantly more severe than those presented by the

Federal Reserve as part of the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) processes. The scenario was designed to demonstrate the Companys ability to withstand an extreme macroeconomic environment and maintain capital

ratios well above any regulatory minimum.    The table below highlights some of the key macroeconomic trends used for this hypothetical exercise:

Description of Risks Included

The Company considers and evaluates all material risks facing the Company in its capital adequacy and stress testing processes including, but not limited to,

the following:

Credit risk is driven by real estate-related lending, large corporate exposures, individual consumer lending and automobile finance exposures. Credit risk is incorporated into the mid-cycle results through

credit-sensitive macroeconomic scenario parameters, modifications to the scenario that account for the Companys business footprint and specific stress applied to significant counterparties. Key macroeconomic drivers include:

An increase in the unemployment rate that is 81 basis points (bps) more severe than any observed peak experience over the last 67 years.

A decline in the Case-Shiller HPI of 34%, more severe than any observed peak to trough experience since 1920.

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events. Operational risk includes legal and compliance risk. Operational risk is

incorporated through elevated adverse experience driven by a severely adverse business environment and through inclusion of specific idiosyncratic operational risk events.

Operational risk losses in the severely adverse scenario forecast are a multiple of historical experience.

Market risk is the risk to the Companys financial condition from changes in interest rates or changes in the market value of assets and traded financial instruments, both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet.

Market risk is incorporated into the mid-cycle results in the macroeconomic scenario through the shape and path of the severely adverse scenario yield curve and through market sensitive macroeconomic scenario parameters such as the forecasted value

of used vehicles.

A decline in the Manheim Index that is 95 bps more severe than any observed peak to trough experience since the indexs inception in 1995.

Liquidity risk is the risk arising from an inability to meet obligations as they come due in the normal course of business without undue hardship or incurring unacceptable loss. Liquidity risk is incorporated into the

mid-cycle results through the macroeconomic scenario.    Description of Methodologies Employed

The Company employs various methodologies in its stress tests for balance sheet, income statement, and capital projections. In general, the Company

utilizes multiple modeling techniques in developing its stress test estimates, including regression-based modeling, transition analytics, business analytics, and other objective, quantitative forecasting methodologies. The Company incorporates

expert judgment to apply management overlays in the analysis of the stress test estimates.    Pre-Provision Net Revenue (PPNR) : PPNR

forecasting methodology consists of multiple models and expert judgment used in conjunction to forecast individual line items for the balance sheet and income statement. Balance sheet and non-interest income and expense are forecasted by

ordinary least squares regression on macroeconomic factors and through expert judgment when a model is not available. Net interest income is primarily forecasted based on interest rates projected and applied to the modeled loan and deposit

balances within the asset/liability management tool. These results are subject to management review and adjustment.    Credit Loss Estimation:

For the purposes of capital planning and loss forecasting, the Company has developed loss forecasting models driven by macroeconomic variables across its commercial, retail and automotive portfolios. Credit loss estimations and PPNR estimations use

balances that are internally consistent. These results are subject to management review and adjustment.    Operational Loss Estimation:  The Company

used a historical averages methodology scaled for severity for the estimation of operational risk. These results are subject to management review and adjustment.

Provision for Loan and Lease Losses : The credit loss stress tests models create estimations for expected reserve levels (both allowance and contingent)

and related provision expenses that the Company will incur under each of the macroeconomic scenarios. The Companys reserve level is determined on an expectation of future net charge offs and built up to absorb those credit

losses. Provision expense is taken at each forecast period to adjust the reserve levels up or down to the necessary levels.    Capital and Risk

Weighted Assets:  The methodologies described above translate identified risks into potential revenue and loss projections over the nine-quarter planning horizon. These projections are aggregated into net income / loss estimates over the

planning horizon. These estimates then feed the Companys regulatory capital estimation process. These regulatory capital calculations are based on

existing regulatory guidance as well as proposed guidance when applicable. Risk-weighted asset calculations are based on Basel III standardized and Basel I generalized capital regulations where

applicable.    Results  Company Run Severely Adverse Stress Test  Holding Company

The results presented below contain forward-looking projections that represent estimates based on the Companys internal severely adverse scenario. The

estimates reflect capital ratios which include the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing Capital Actions described above.    The results demonstrate that, even

under this negative environment, the Company would maintain regulatory capital ratios well above regulatory minimums and well above the required minimum capital ratios set by the Federal Reserve for CCAR.

Under the severely adverse scenario, the most significant drivers of the Companys regulatory capital ratios are:

Credit losses and provisions associated with the macroeconomic environment within the retail mortgage, automobile and commercial real estate portfolios;

Negative impact on PPNR associated with the macroeconomic environment in net interest income driven by lower balances from credit deterioration and lower origination volumes in the commercial real estate and retail

mortgage portfolios;

Negative impacts from PPNR and credit provisions reduced by lower total risk-weighted assets driven by a contracting balance sheet;

Negative impacts from a reduction of eligible additional Tier 2 capital instruments in regulatory capital; and

Negative impact from an increase in disallowed deferred tax asset driven by deterioration in forecasted taxable income.

"    On February 14, 2018, DDR Corp., an Ohio corporation

(DDR), encumbered certain properties with a mortgage loan as described below in furtherance of its previously announced plan to spin off these properties in the summer of 2018 into a separate publicly-traded REIT named Retail Value Inc.

(RVI). Specifically, on February 14, 2018 certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of DDR (collectively, the Borrowers) entered into a Loan Agreement (the Loan Agreement) with Column Financial, Inc. (an affiliate of

Credit Suisse AG), JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (collectively, the Lenders).    The Loan

Agreement provides for a secured loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $1,350,000,000 (the Loan Facility). The Borrowers obligations to pay the principal, interest and other amounts under the Loan Facility are

evidenced by certain promissory notes executed by the Borrowers as of February 14, 2018 (collectively, the Notes). The Notes are secured by, among other things: (i) certain mortgages encumbering the Borrowers respective

properties (a total of 38 properties) located in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin and

(ii) an equity pledge from the entity that owns 100% of the direct interests in the Borrowers that own the properties (a total of 12 properties) in Puerto Rico, a pledge in rents and other cash flows, insurance proceeds and condemnation awards

in connection with the 12 properties in Puerto Rico, and a pledge of any reserves and accounts of any Borrower.    The Loan Facility will mature on

February 9, 2021, subject to two  one-year  extensions at Borrowers option conditioned upon, among other items, satisfaction of certain Continental U.S. debt yield and Continental U.S.  loan-to-value  (based on appraisal values determined at the time of the initial closing) requirements. The initial weighted-average interest rate applicable to the Notes is

equal to  one-month  LIBOR plus a spread of 3.30% per annum, provided that such spread is subject to (i) amendment upon the occurrence of certain events and (ii) an increase of 0.25% per annum in

connection with any exercise of the first extension option and an additional increase of 0.25% per annum in connection with any exercise of the second extension option. Borrowers are required to maintain an interest rate cap with respect to the

principal amount of the Notes having (i) during the initial term of the Loan Facility, a LIBOR strike rate equal to 3.0% and (ii) with respect to any extension period, a LIBOR strike rate that would result in a debt service coverage ratio

of 1.20x based on the Continental U.S. properties.    The Loan Facility is structured as an interest only loan throughout the initial three-year term and

any exercised extension options. However, amounts outstanding under the Loan Facility will begin to amortize through the application of excess property cash flows following the  one-year  anniversary of the

closing date in the event the Borrowers fail to meet certain Continental U.S. debt yield thresholds from operating income and property sales.    Subject to

certain conditions described in the Loan Agreement, the Borrowers may prepay the outstanding loan amount in whole or in part by providing (i) advance notice of prepayment to the Lenders and (ii) remitting the prepayment premium described

in the Loan Agreement. No prepayment premium is required with respect to any prepayments made after March 9, 2019. Additionally, no prepayment premium will apply to prepayments made in connection with permitted property sales. Each Continental

U.S. property will be assigned a required release price representing minimum disposition proceeds for that asset; properties in Puerto Rico will not have minimum release prices. The amount of proceeds from sales of Continental U.S. properties

required to be applied towards prepayment of the Notes will depend upon the Continental U.S. debt yield at the time of the sale; all proceeds from sales of Puerto Rico properties are required to be used to prepay the Notes. Under certain

circumstances, prepayments of the Notes may be applied by the servicer to senior and junior tranches of Notes on a  non-ratable  basis.

In the event of a default, the contract rate of interest on the Notes will increase to the lesser of (i) the maximum rate allowed by law, or

(ii) the greater of (A) 4% above the interest rate otherwise applicable and (B) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Loan Agreement) plus 1.0%. The Notes contain other terms and provisions that are customary for instruments of this nature.

In addition, RVI executed a certain Environmental Indemnity Agreement and a certain Guaranty Agreement in favor of the Lenders under which RVI agreed to

indemnify the Lenders for certain environmental risks and guaranty the Borrowers obligations under the exceptions to the  non-recourse  provisions in the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement includes

representations, warranties, affirmative and restrictive covenants and other provisions customary for agreements of this nature. The Loan Agreement also includes customary events of default, including,

among others, principal and interest payment defaults, and breaches of affirmative or negative covenants. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Lenders may avail themselves of various

customary remedies under the Loan Agreement and other agreements executed in connection therewith or applicable law, including accelerating the Loan Facility and realizing on the real property collateral or pledged collateral.

Certain of the Lenders, or their affiliates, are lenders under DDRs $950 million revolving credit facility and JP Morgan Chase Bank, National

Association serves as Administrative Agent under such facility. Furthermore, certain of the Lenders and/or their affiliates have in the past provided, are currently providing and in the future may provide investment banking, commercial banking and

other financial services to DDR in the ordinary course of their business, for which they have received or will receive customary compensation. In the ordinary course of their business, such financial institutions and/or their affiliates may

Base is defined as (i) 80% of the gross face amount of Spys eligible accounts receivable, plus (ii) 15% of the current market cost of raw materials and finished goods that constitute Spys eligible inventory, not to exceed

$1,000,000. Spys obligations under the Agreement are guarantied by Orange 21 Inc. pursuant to the General Continuing Guaranty executed by Orange 21 Inc. in favor of Lender on February 26, 2007 (the  Guaranty ).

Loans extended pursuant to the Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum of 2.5% above the higher of (i) the prime rate as

reported in the western edition of the Wall Street Journal from time to time or (ii) 8%. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default (as defined below) the interest rate on amounts outstanding under the Agreement will

be increased three percentage points above the interest rate in effect immediately prior to such event of default. Interest will be payable monthly in arrears and Spy is required to pay at least $2,000 a month in interest regardless of the amounts

outstanding under the Agreement at any particular time.    Spy has granted Lender a security interest in all of its assets as security for

its obligations under the Agreement, except for its copyrights, patents, trademarks, servicemarks and related applications. Spy has also established a bank account in Lenders name into which collections on accounts receivable and other

collateral are deposited (the  Collateral Account ). Pursuant to the deposit control account agreement between Spy and Lender with respect to the Collateral Account, Lender is entitled to sweep all amounts deposited into the

Collateral Account and apply the funds to outstanding obligations under the Agreement; provided that Lender is required to distribute to Spy any amounts remaining after payment of all amounts due under the Agreement. To secure its obligations under

the Guaranty, Orange 21 Inc. has agreed to grant Lender, within 30 days of the date of the Agreement, a blanket security interest in all of its assets, except for its stock in Spy, which it has covenanted not to pledge to any other person or entity.

The Agreement imposes certain covenants on Spy, including covenants requiring Spy to (i) deliver financial statements and inventory

and accounts payable reports to Lender; (ii) maintain certain minimum levels of insurance; (iii) make required payments under all leases; (iv) refrain from incurring additional debt in excess of $100,000; (v) maintain its

corporate name, structure and existence; (vi) refrain from paying dividends; (vii) notify Lender in advance of relocating its premises; and (viii) refrain from substantially changing its management or business.    The Agreement has an initial term of 12 months (the  Basic Term ) and thereafter shall automatically renew for successive 12 months

periods (each a  Renewal Term ) so long as neither Spy nor Lender delivers written notice of its intention to terminate the Agreement. During any Renewal Term, the Agreement may be terminated by either party on at least 30 days

prior written notice to the other party. If Lender delivers notice that it intends to terminate the Agreement, other than in connection with an event of default, Spy may request that the Agreement remain in effect for an additional 60 days beyond

the intended termination date for Spy to obtain replacement financing. If the Agreement is terminated by Lender as the result of an Event of Default, Spy is required to pay a prepayment fee equal to the minimum applicable monthly interest payment

multiplied by the number of months remaining in the applicable Basic Term or Renewal Term at the time of such termination.    The term

Event of Default is defined under the Agreement to include, among other things: a payment default; a material failure to perform Spys other obligations under the Agreement; a material adverse change in Spys business or the

Lenders security interest or prospect of repayment; insolvency; certain defaults under agreements with third parties; misrepresentations; unsatisfied judgments against Spy and termination of any guaranties. Upon the occurrence and continuance

of an Event of Default, Lender may, without notice or demand, declare all obligations under the Agreement immediately due and payable and proceed against the collateral, among other rights and remedies.

This Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibits hereto, contains forward-looking statements (including forward-looking statements relating to the

believe, will, anticipate, emerging, intend, plan, could, may, estimate, should, objective, goal,

possible, potential, project and similar words and expressions, but such words and phrases are not the exclusive means of identifying them, and (2) are subject to risks and uncertainties and represent

VASCOs present expectations or beliefs concerning future events. VASCO cautions that the forward-looking statements are qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by,

the forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include the risk that the Acquisition is not completed on a timely basis or at all; VASCOs ability to integrate Silanis into the business of VASCO

successfully and the amount of time and expense spent and incurred in connection with the integration; the risk that the revenue synergies, cost savings and other economic benefits that VASCO anticipates as a result of the Acquisition are not fully

realized or take longer to realize than expected; and the risks, uncertainties and other factors that have been described in VASCOs Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, which include, but are not limited to,

(a) risks of general market conditions, including currency fluctuations and the uncertainties resulting from turmoil in world economic and financial markets, (b) risks inherent to the computer and network security industry, including

rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, increasingly sophisticated hacking attempts, increasing numbers of patent infringement claims, changes in customer requirements, price competitive bidding and changing government regulations,

and (c) risks specific to VASCO, including demand for its products and services, competition from more established firms and others, pressures on price levels and its historical dependence on relatively few products, certain suppliers and

certain key customers. Thus, the results that VASCO actually achieves may differ materially from any anticipated results expressed in, or implied by, these statements. Except for VASCOs ongoing obligations to disclose material information as

As of October 31, 2016, Industrial Property Trust Inc. (the Company) owned and managed, either directly or through its 20.0% ownership

interest in a joint venture partnership, a real estate portfolio that included properties with an aggregate total purchase price of approximately $2.8 billion, comprised of 240 industrial buildings totaling approximately 38.3 million square

feet located in 25 markets throughout the U.S., with 473 customers, and was 91.9% occupied (92.7% leased) with a weighted-average remaining lease term (based on square feet) of approximately 4.7 years. The occupied rate reflects the square footage

with a paying customer in place. The leased rate includes the occupied square footage and additional square footage with leases in place that have not yet commenced. As of October 31, 2016:

226 industrial buildings totaling approximately 36.0 million square feet comprised the Companys operating portfolio, which includes stabilized properties, and was 95.3% occupied (95.5% leased). The

Companys operating portfolio has an estimated weighted-average aggregate purchase price capitalization rate of approximately 5.3% (5.5% excluding contractual free rent during a portion of the year following acquisition for certain of the

properties).

14 industrial buildings totaling approximately 2.3 million square feet comprised the Companys development and value-add portfolio, which includes buildings acquired with the intention to reposition or

redevelop, or buildings recently completed which have not yet reached stabilization. The Company generally considers a building to be stabilized on the earlier to occur of the first anniversary of a buildings shell completion date or achieving

90% occupancy.    As of October 31, 2016, the Company owned and managed 27 industrial buildings totaling approximately 4.4 million

square feet of the total 38.3 million square feet (discussed above) through its 20.0% ownership interest in a joint venture partnership.    The

weighted-average aggregate purchase price capitalization rate is calculated based on the aggregate projected cash net operating income from in-place leases for the 12 months from the date of the respective acquisition, including any contractual rent

increases contained in such leases for those 12 months, divided by the aggregate purchase price, exclusive of transfer taxes, due diligence expenses, and other closing costs including acquisition costs and fees paid to the Companys advisor and

its affiliates.    Forward-Looking Statement    This

Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements (such as those concerning the remaining lease terms and the weighted-average aggregate purchase price capitalization rate) that are based on the Companys current expectations,

plans, estimates, assumptions, and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, risks associated with the Companys customers ability to continue to comply with the terms of their leases, and those

"    Purchase and Sale Agreements    On December 14, 2012, The Laclede

Group, Inc. (Laclede), through two newly formed wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Acquisition Subsidiaries), entered into definitive agreements to acquire (collectively the Transaction) from Southern Union

Company (SUG), an affiliate of Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. (ETE) and Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (ETP), substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Missouri Gas Energy (MGE) and New England

Gas Company (NEG). MGE and NEG, each a division of SUG, are primarily engaged in the local distribution of natural gas to approximately 500,000 and 50,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in western Missouri and

Massachusetts, respectively.    Each acquisition will be effected pursuant to a separate purchase and sale agreement among

Laclede, the applicable Acquisition Subsidiary and SUG (respectively, the MGE Acquisition Agreement and the NEG Acquisition Agreement, and collectively, the Acquisition Agreements). The consideration for the

Transaction is $1.035 billion, consisting of $975 million for MGE and $60 million for NEG less, in the case of NEG, the assumption of nearly $20 million of long-term debt. In each case, the consideration will be subject to certain post-closing

adjustments in accordance with the terms of the applicable Acquisition Agreement. Laclede has guaranteed the performance of all obligations of each Acquisition Subsidiary under each Acquisition Agreement, including the payment of the purchase price.

Representations, Warranties and Covenants    Each Acquisition Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants of the respective Acquisition Subsidiary and SUG. SUG will operate MGE and NEG, as the case may be, in the ordinary

course until the Transaction is consummated, with customary limitations on capital expenditures and restrictions on initiation of general rate proceedings and entry into material contracts during such period. SUG has also agreed to cooperate with

the Acquisition Subsidiaries efforts to obtain permanent financing, including preparing and delivering audited financial statements for MGE and NEG. The Acquisitions are not subject to any financing condition. See Financing

Commitment below.    Each Acquisition Subsidiary and SUG have agreed to indemnify each other for breaches of

representations, warranties and covenants, as well as losses resulting from assets or liabilities assumed or retained by each party, as applicable. SUGs aggregate liability with respect to such indemnification obligations across both

Acquisition Agreements is capped at $100 million for MGE and $12 million for NEG (except each Acquisition Agreement caps liability for breaches of the representations and warranties related to capitalization and title to assets at the respective

purchase price).    Conditions to Closing    Consummation of the Transaction is subject to customary conditions, including, without limitation: (i) the expiration or early termination of the waiting period applicable to the Transaction under

the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and any required approvals thereunder, (ii) the receipt of required approvals from the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities and the Missouri Public Service

Commission, as applicable, and (iii) the absence of any law, injunction, judgment or ruling prohibiting or restraining the Transaction. Laclede is required to agree to divestitures and business restructuring, subject to certain limitations, to

obtain antitrust and regulatory approvals.    Termination    The Acquisition Agreements contain certain termination rights for both the respective Acquisition Subsidiary and SUG, including, among others, the right to terminate if the Transaction is not completed by

October 14, 2013 (subject to up to four 30-day extensions under certain circumstances related to obtaining required regulatory approvals). In the event that SUG terminates the MGE Acquisition Agreement as a result of the failure of Laclede to

obtain financing, the applicable Acquisition Subsidiary (and by its guarantee Laclede) may be required to pay SUG a reverse break up fee of $73.125 million, which amount will operate as liquidated damages and a cap on such Acquisition

Subsidiarys and Lacledes combined liability for such breach.    Copies of the Acquisition Agreements are filed as

Exhibit 2.1 and Exhibit 2.2 to this report and are incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Acquisition Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Acquisition Agreements.

Employee Agreements    On December 14, 2012, each Acquisition Subsidiary also entered into an employee agreement (together, the Employee Agreements) with Laclede and SUG to provide for the terms and conditions

of their employment of persons currently employed by each of MGE and NEG. The Employee Agreements provide for base compensation and benefits for the employees substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to that in effect prior to the consummation of

the Transaction.    Copies of the Employee Agreements are filed as Exhibit 2.3 and Exhibit 2.4 to this report and are

incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Employment Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Employment Agreements.

The Acquisition Agreements and Employee Agreements have been included to provide security holders with information regarding their terms.

It is not intended to provide factual information about Laclede or SUG and should not be relied on by any other person or entity for any purposes. The Acquisition Agreements and Employee Agreements contain representations and warranties that each

Acquisition Subsidiary and SUG made to each other as of specific dates and to evidence their agreement on various issues. The assertions and other statements or disclosures embodied in those representations and warranties were made solely for

purposes of the contract between each Acquisition Subsidiary and SUG and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations or other factors agreed to by each Acquisition Subsidiary or SUG in connection with the negotiated terms, which

qualifications and limitations are not necessarily reflected in the Acquisition Agreements and Employee Agreements. Moreover, some of those representations and warranties may not be accurate or complete as of any specified date, may be subject to a

contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to investors or may have been used for purposes of allocating risk between each Acquisition Subsidiary and SUG rather than establishing matters as fact. Based on the

foregoing, you should not rely on the representations, warranties and disclosures included in the Acquisition Agreements and Employee Agreements as statements of factual information.    Financing Commitment    On December 14, 2012, Laclede entered

into a commitment letter (the Commitment Letter) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (collectively, Wells Fargo). Pursuant to the Commitment Letter, Wells Fargo has committed to provide

a 364-day senior bridge term loan credit facility (the Bridge Term Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.020 billion to fund the Transaction. The commitment is subject to various conditions, including (i) the

absence of a material adverse effect having occurred with respect to either Laclede or MGE and NEG on a combined basis, (ii) no event of default existing under any other financing immediately prior to or after the making of any loan under the

Bridge Term Facility, (iii) the execution of satisfactory definitive documentation and (iv) other customary closing conditions. Any permanent debt and equity financing obtained by Laclede on or prior to the closing of the Transaction will

reduce the amount of the commitment.    A copy of the Commitment Letter is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is

"    Sales Agency Financing Agreements

On September 9, 2016, DDR Corp. (the Company) entered into separate Sales Agency Financing Agreements, each dated as of

September 9, 2016 (such agreements, the Sales Agreements), with BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC (BNYMCM), KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. (KBCM) and Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. (SCUSA), respectively.

BNYMCM, KBCM and SCUSA are referred to collectively as the Sales Agents. Under the terms of the Sales Agreements, the Company may, from time to time, (1) issue and sell its common shares, par value $0.10 per share (Common

Shares), through the Sales Agents and (2) enter into forward sale agreements (such agreements, Forward Sale Agreements) under separate Master Forward Sale Agreements (as defined below) and related supplemental confirmations,

between the Company and (1) an affiliate of BNYMCM, (2) KBCM or (3) an affiliate of SCUSA (in such capacity, a Forward Purchaser). In connection with each such Forward Sale Agreement, the relevant Forward Purchaser will,

at the Companys request and subject to the terms and conditions in the Forward Sale Agreements, borrow from third parties and, through the relevant Sales Agent (in such capacity, a Forward Seller), sell a number of Common Shares

equal to the number of Common Shares underlying such Forward Sale Agreement to hedge such Forward Sale Agreement. In no event will the aggregate number of Common Shares sold through the Sales Agents, each as an agent for the Company and as a Forward

Seller, under the Sales Agreements have an aggregate sales price in excess of $250,000,000.    The sales, if any, of Common Shares under any

Sales Agreement will be made in at the market offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, including sales made directly on the New York Stock Exchange, the existing trading market for the Common Shares, or sales made

to or through a market maker or through an electronic communications network. In addition, the Common Shares may be offered and sold by such other methods, including privately negotiated transactions, as the Company and any Sales Agent agree to in

writing.    The Company will pay each Sales Agent a commission at a mutually agreed rate that will not exceed, but may be lower than, 2.0%

of the sales price of all Common Shares sold through it as Sales Agent for the Company under the applicable Sales Agreement. The Company has agreed to reimburse the Sales Agents, the Forward Sellers and the Forward Purchasers for their reasonable

documented out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and expenses of counsel (up to $50,000 in the aggregate), as well as legal fees in connection with continuing due diligence (up to $15,000 in the aggregate for any fiscal quarter) in connection with

their respective services under the Sales Agreements.    In connection with each Forward Sale Agreement, the relevant Forward Seller will

receive, in the form of a reduced initial forward sale price, selling commissions at a mutually agreed rate that will not exceed, but may be lower than, 2.0% of the volume weighted average of the sales prices of all borrowed Common Shares sold

during the applicable period by it as a Forward Seller.    The Common Shares will be sold pursuant to the Companys automatic shelf

registration statement (the Registration Statement) on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-205059) filed on June 18, 2015 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company filed a prospectus supplement, dated

September 9, 2016, to the prospectus, dated June 18, 2015, with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the offer and sale of the Common Shares.

The Sales Agreements are filed as Exhibit 1.1, Exhibit 1.2 and Exhibit 1.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by

reference. This description of the material terms of the Sales Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibits.    Master Forward

Sale Agreements    On September 9, 2016, the Company entered into separate Master Confirmations for Forward Stock Sale Transactions

(the Master Forward Sale Agreements) with The Bank of New York Mellon, KBCM and The Bank of Nova Scotia, respectively, as Forward Purchasers. Under the terms of the Master Forward Sale Agreements, the Company may from time to time enter

into one or more Forward Sale Agreements. In connection with each Forward Sale Agreement, the relevant Forward Purchaser will, at the Companys request, borrow from third parties and, through the relevant Forward Seller, sell a number of Common

Shares equal to the number of Common Shares underlying such Forward Sale Agreement to hedge such Forward Sale Agreement; provided, however, that BNYMCM will not make forward sales until its affiliate provides notice to the Company pursuant to the

Forward Sale Agreement.

The initial forward sale price per share under each Forward Sale Agreement will equal the product

of (1) an amount equal to one minus the applicable selling commission and (2) the volume weighted average price per share at which the borrowed Common Shares were sold pursuant to the relevant Sales Agreement by the relevant Forward Seller

to hedge the relevant Forward Purchasers exposure under such Forward Sale Agreement. Thereafter, the initial forward sale price will be subject to the price adjustment provisions of the relevant Forward Sale Agreement. If the Company elects to

physically settle any Forward Sale Agreement by delivering Common Shares, the Company will receive an amount of cash from the relevant Forward Purchaser equal to the product of the initial forward sale price per share under such Forward Sale

Agreement and the number of Common Shares underlying such Forward Sale Agreement, subject to the price adjustment and other provisions of such Forward Sale Agreement. The Forward Sale Agreements, the maximum terms of which may not exceed six months,

will provide that the initial forward sale price, as well as the sales prices used to calculate the initial forward sale price, will be subject to adjustment based on a floating interest rate factor equal to the federal funds rate less a spread. In

addition, the initial forward sale price will be subject to decrease on certain dates specified in the relevant Forward Sale Agreement by the amount per share of quarterly dividends the Company currently expects to declare during the term of such

Forward Sale Agreement. If the federal funds rate is less than the spread on any day, the interest rate factor will result in a daily reduction of the forward sale price.

Except under the circumstances described below, the Company has the right, in lieu of physical settlement of any Forward Sale Agreement, to

elect cash or net share settlement of such Forward Sale Agreement. If the Company elects cash or net share settlement of any Forward Sale Agreement, the relevant Forward Purchaser or one of its affiliates will purchase Common Shares in secondary

market transactions over an unwind period to:

deliver Common Shares to stock lenders in order to unwind such Forward Purchasers hedge (after taking into consideration any Common Shares to be delivered by the Company to such Forward Purchaser, in the case of

net share settlement); and

in the case of net share settlement, deliver Common Shares to the Company in settlement of such Forward Sale Agreement.

If the price of the Common Shares at which these purchases are made is below the relevant forward sale price, such Forward Purchaser will pay

the Company such difference in cash (if the Company elects to cash settle) or deliver Common Shares to the Company having a market value equal to such difference (if the Company elects to net share settle). If the price of the Common Shares at which

these purchases are made exceeds the relevant forward sale price, the Company will pay such Forward Purchaser an amount in cash equal to such difference (if the Company elects to cash settle) or the Company will deliver to such Forward Purchaser a

number of Common Shares having a market value equal to such difference (if the Company elects to net share settle). Any such difference could be significant. In addition, these purchases of Common Shares by such Forward Purchaser or one of its

affiliates could cause the price of the Common Shares to increase over time, thereby increasing the number of Common Shares or amount of cash the Company owes to such Forward Purchaser upon net share or cash settlement or decreasing the number of

Common Shares or amount of cash the Forward Purchaser would owe to the Company upon cash or net share settlement.    A Forward Purchaser

will have the right to accelerate each Forward Sale Agreement that it enters into with the Company and to require the Company to physically settle on a date specified by such Forward Purchaser if (1) it or its affiliate is unable to hedge (or

maintain a hedge of) its exposure under such Forward Sale Agreement after using commercially reasonable efforts because (x) insufficient amounts of Common Shares have been made available for borrowing by share lenders or (y) such Forward

Purchaser or its affiliate would incur a stock loan cost in excess of a specified threshold, (2) the Company declares any dividend or distribution on the Common Shares payable in (a) cash in excess of a specified amount,

granted the option to purchase 100,000 shares of the Companys common stock under the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan. The grant provided for 25% vesting on each anniversary of the grant date; however, this was superceded by the option vesting

acceleration action by the Company at the end of December 2005.

The exercise price of options of HealthExtras may be paid in cash or in shares of the Companys common stock, valued at fair market value on the exercise date. All stock

options were granted with an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Companys stock on the grant date.

(2)

The potential realizable value is calculated based on the term of the option at its time of grant (ten years). It is calculated assuming that the fair market value of the

Companys common stock on the date of grant appreciates at the indicated annual rate compounded annually for the entire term of the option and that the option is exercised and sold on the last day of its term for the appreciated stock price.

Option Value at Fiscal Year End    The following table provides information regarding unexercised stock options for Messrs. Blair, Donovan, Farah and Grujich as of December 31, 2005. Messrs. Donovan, Farah and Grujich did not exercise any stock options during the year

ended December 31, 2005. Information regarding Mr. Blairs exercises is presented below.

Value of an unexercised in-the-money option is determined by subtracting the exercise price per share from the fair market value per share for the underlying shares as of

December 31, 2005, multiplied by the number of such underlying shares. The fair market value of the Companys common stock is based upon the last reported sale price as reported on the Nasdaq National Market on December 31, 2005

($25.10 per share).    Employment Agreements    HealthExtras has executed employment agreements with David T. Blair, Michael P. Donovan and Nick J. Grujich.    The employment agreements for Messrs. Blair, Donovan and Grujich, are substantially similar, and provide for three-year terms. Pursuant to his employment agreement, and Compensation Committee actions taken consistent with that agreement,

Mr. Blairs base salary is

7

currently $350,000 per year, and Mr. Blair was granted a cash bonus of $380,000 related to 2005 performance.

Pursuant to his employment agreement, and Compensation Committee actions taken consistent with that agreement, Mr. Donovans base salary is currently $280,000 per year, and Mr. Donovan was granted a cash bonus of $150,000 related to

2005 performance. Pursuant to his employment agreement, and Compensation Committee actions taken consistent with that agreement, Mr. Grujichs base salary is currently $237,500 per year, and Mr. Grujich was granted a cash bonus of

$100,000 related to 2005 performance. The Compensation Committee reviews salaries for executive officers annually and, pursuant to the employment agreements for Messrs. Blair, Donovan and Grujich, can increase Mr. Blairs base salary as

Chief Executive Officer and, on the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer, can increase Mr. Donovans and/or Mr. Grujichs base salary. In addition to base salary, the employment agreements provide for, among other

things, participation by the executives in employee benefit plans, an automobile allowance and other fringe benefits, and reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in advancing the Companys business.    Upon termination of any executives employment for cause, or upon an executives voluntary resignation, that executive shall be entitled only

to such compensation and benefits as shall have accrued through the date of the executives termination or resignation, as the case may be. In the event that an executives employment is terminated for any reason other than for cause or

voluntary resignation, including termination by reason of death or disability, then the executive shall receive payments under the employment agreement due for the remaining term of the employment agreement, provided that such payment shall not be

less than the payment due for a 12-month period. However, upon termination by the Company of an executives employment within eighteen months after a change in control, the executive shall be entitled to the same rights, payments and benefits

as provided for in the event that the executive is terminated for any reason other than for cause or voluntary resignation, including termination by reason of death or disability, except that in lieu of the continuation of base salary, the executive

shall be entitled to a lump sum payment equal to two times the executives base salary. Upon an executives voluntary resignation or termination for cause during the term of the agreement, each employment agreement generally provides that,

for a period of two years from the date of termination, the executive will not compete directly or indirectly with HealthExtras business, nor will the executive solicit or contract with entities contracting with HealthExtras. In the event

payments made under the agreement or under any other arrangement or plan to an executive in connection with a change in control would subject the executive to the so-called golden parachute excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the

executives payments under the agreement will be reduced to the extent needed so that the executive would not be subject to such exercise tax.

Includes shares of common stock which may be acquired within sixty days upon the exercise of outstanding options.    The Company has established a stock trading plan in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b5-1 of the  Securities Exchange Act of

1934 . The Rule 10b5-1 plan is designed to enable executives of the Company to avoid any real or perceived conflict of interest in connection with the trading of the Companys securities.    Certain Transactions    During 2005, the Company

received legal services from Epstein Becker & Green, P.C. (EBG), a law firm in which Mr. Steven Epstein, a Director of the Company, is both a shareholder and executive committee member. Before Mr. Epstein was elected

to the Board of the Company, the Company engaged EBG for legal services on a variety of matters and has continued to do so since that time. EBG, one of several law firms routinely providing services to the Company on an as-needed basis, renders its

services at the hourly rates typically charged to its other clients, and there is no retainer agreement or other form of contract obligating the use of EBG or creating a financial penalty for not using EBG. The Companys legal fees from EBG

were approximately $331,000 in 2005. The Board has determined that Mr. Epsteins status as a shareholder and executive committee member of EBG does not affect his independence as a member of the Companys Board or Nominating

Committee. The foregoing related-party transaction has been reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee.

Accountant Fees and Services    The following fees were paid to our independent registered public accountants for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, and we have determined that the provisions for these services is compatible with

(3)

Includes the audit of the Companys 401(k) benefit plan.    Policy

on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    The Audit

Committee is responsible for appointing, setting compensation and overseeing the work of the independent registered public accounting firm. In accordance with its charter, the Audit Committee approves, in advance, all audit and permissible non-audit

services to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm. This approval process ensures that the firm does not provide any non-audit services to the Company that are prohibited by law or regulation.    Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance    Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Companys executive officers, directors and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of the Companys equity securities, to file reports of

ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.    Based solely on a review of copies of such reports of ownership furnished to the Company, or written representations that no forms were necessary, the

Company believes that during the past fiscal year, its executive officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners complied with all applicable filing requirements.    Code of Ethics and Conduct    The Company, together with its subsidiaries, insists that all of its

directors, officers and

11

employees adhere to high ethical standards and comply with all applicable legal requirements when engaging in business on

behalf of the Company. Accordingly, the Board adopted a Code of Ethics and Conduct which complies with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Nasdaq Stock Market Rules, and is applicable to all of the Companys directors, officers and

employees. A copy of the Code of Ethics and Conduct will be furnished without charge upon written request to the Corporate Secretary, HealthExtras, Inc., 800 King Farm Boulevard, 4th Floor, Rockville, Maryland 20850.    The Company has established a toll-free telephone number for employees to use on a confidential basis to advise the General Counsel of any

questions, reports or concerns regarding possible violations of the Companys Code of Ethics and Conduct or of any Company policies or procedures. Employees are also invited to write to the General Counsel on a confidential basis regarding such

matters. In addition, the Audit Committee, in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has established procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal controls or auditing matters, and to allow

for the confidential, anonymous submission by employees of concerns regarding any such matters (see also Stockholder Communications with the Board). In no event will any action be taken against an employee for, in good faith, making a

complaint or reporting known or suspected violations.     Recent Developments    On March 15, 2006, we announced that H.E.R.E.I.U. Welfare Funds had selected our subsidiary, Catalyst Rx, to provide pharmacy benefit management

services effective June 1, 2006. H.E.R.E.I.U. is a multi-employer Taft-Hartley Fund representing over 225,000 participants across the country, the largest concentrations of which are in Las Vegas, Chicago, New York and Atlantic City.

In addition, on March 21, 2006, we announced that we had been notified by the Maryland Department of Budget and Management that it

will recommend the award to Catalyst Rx of a five-year pharmacy management contract relating to more that 200,000 members and their eligible dependents for approval by the Maryland Board of Public Works. If this award is approved by the Maryland

Board of Public Works, it is anticipated to have a third quarter effective date.    We will have to incur certain implementation costs and

pre-operation costs for these two contracts prior to their effective dates. Such costs will be in addition to the implementation and pre-operation costs which we have been and will continue to incur in preparation for the July 1, 2006 effective

date for Catalyst Rx to provide pharmacy benefit management services to the more than 1.3 million members of Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Iowa, which we announced on January 3, 2006.    As discussed under Risk Factors in our Form 10-K Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2005, if we lose key clients, including

as a result of their cancellation of their agreements, consolidation of clients or as a result of competitive bidding in the renewal of contracts, our business, profitability and growth prospects could suffer. While our PBM contracts generally

12

specify multi-year terms, many, including those with public agencies such as the State of Louisiana and potentially with

the State of Maryland, allow for cancellation by the client on relatively short notice. While the Company has never had a material multi-year agreement cancelled before its full term, and has frequently been successful in negotiating contract

extensions, there can be no assurance that such cancellations might not occur in the future.

August 12, 2009, the Company submitted to the FCC a petition for rulemaking seeking to clarify, among other things, rules governing the reimbursement of minutes from the Interstate Telecommunications Relay Services Fund (the TRS

Fund) for multi-party calls between deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals and persons who may or may not have such disabilities. On September 18, 2009, the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau of the FCC issued an Order dismissing the

Companys petition with respect to the Companys request concerning multi-party calls and stated that calls not involving a hearing individual are not compensable.    The Company believes that the dismissal of the Companys petition by the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau of the FCC was

inappropriate and intends to file for reconsideration in an application for review, and, if necessary, to judicially or administratively appeal the Order in the appropriate venue.    The TRS Fund is administered by the National Exchange Carriers Association (NECA). In the event the FCC decides not to

reconsider the Companys petition for rulemaking or otherwise decides not to permit reimbursement for multi-party calls that do not include a hearing person, and the Companys efforts to appeal the Order are unsuccessful, the Company will

no longer be reimbursed by NECA for such calls. The Company is in the process of determining what portion of its receipts from NECA are attributable to multi-party calls not involving a hearing person and what impact the FCCs ruling, if

upheld, would have on the financial statements of the Company. The inability to collect reimbursement for such multi-party calls would reduce the Companys revenue and cash flow and the Company believes it would likely have a material adverse

effect on the Companys business and results of operations.",FALSE

"   On September 27, 2019, Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the ""Company"") and Briggs & Stratton AG (""B&S AG""), as borrowers, entered into a $625 million revolving credit agreement (the ""Credit Agreement"") with various financial institutions party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent.  The Credit Agreement replaces that certain multicurrency credit agreement among the Company, B&S AG, various financial institutions party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, dated as of March 25, 2016.  The Company intends to use the new revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, which may include the retirement of its $195 million of outstanding 6.875% Senior Notes due December 2020 (the ""Senior Notes""). The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility scheduled to mature on September 27, 2024, subject to a springing maturity date if the Senior Notes are not refinanced more than 91 days prior to their maturity date.  The initial maximum availability under the revolving credit facility is $625 million, consisting of a $585 million North American revolving facility and a $40 million Swiss revolving facility, in each case subject to a borrowing base consisting of certain eligible cash, accounts, inventory, equipment, trademarks and real estate.  As of September 27, 2019, approximately $370.8 million of revolving loans were drawn under the Credit Agreement.  Availability under the revolving credit facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit, of which approximately $1.5 million were outstanding as of September 27, 2019.  The Company may from time to time increase the maximum availability under the Credit Agreement by up to $350 million if certain conditions are satisfied, including (i) the absence of any event of default under the Credit Agreement, and (ii) the Company obtaining the consent of the lenders participating in each such increase. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement generally bear interest at a variable rate equal to (i) LIBOR for the applicable interest period plus a specified margin based upon the Company's consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) (the ""Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio""), or (ii) the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the U.S. prime rate quoted by The Wall Street Journal, (b) the greater of (x) the federal funds rate and (y) the overnight bank funding rate, plus in each case 0.50%, and (c) the sum of 1% plus one-month LIBOR) plus a specified margin based upon the Company's Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. The Company must also pay (1) an unused line fee on the aggregate amount of revolving commitments that are unused from time to time in the amount of 25.0 basis points per annum, (2) letter of credit participation fees to the lenders under the Credit Agreement ranging from 150.0 to 225.0 basis points per annum on the undrawn amount of letters of credit, determined based upon the Company's Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio from time to time and (3) letter of credit fronting fees to each issuer of letters of credit under the Credit Agreement in the amount of 12.5 basis points per annum on the undrawn amount of the letters of credit issued by such issuer.   The Credit Agreement contains various restrictions and covenants applicable to the Company and, with certain exceptions, its subsidiaries.  Among other requirements, if aggregate availability under the Credit Agreement decreases to below the greater of 12.5% of the line cap (defined as the lesser of the aggregate commitments and the aggregate borrowing base) and $50 million (the ""FCCR Test Amount""), the Company may not permit the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio to be less than 1.0 to 1.0 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, until aggregate availability under the Credit Agreement exceeds the FCCR Test Amount for at least 30 consecutive days.   Various subsidiaries of the Company are guarantors, and in the future will be required to become guarantors, of the Company's and certain other subsidiaries' obligations from time to time arising under the Credit Agreement and under certain hedging and banking services agreements.

Certain additional subsidiaries of the Company may from time to time become borrowers under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default.  If an event of default under the Credit Agreement occurs and is continuing, then the administrative agent may declare any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable.  In addition, if, among other things, the Company, B&S AG, any other subsidiary borrower under the Credit Agreement, while it remains a borrower under the Credit Agreement, or any other material subsidiary becomes the subject of voluntary or involuntary proceedings under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, then any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement will automatically become immediately due and payable.",TRUE

"   Third Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement    On December 15, 2021, FS Credit Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (the "" Company "") entered into the Third Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement (the "" New   Advisory Agreement ""), effective as of November 30, 2021, by and between the Company and FS Real Estate Advisor, LLC (the "" Adviser ""). The New Advisory Agreement amends and restates the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, dated as of August 17, 2018 (as amended, the "" Prior Agreement ""), to permit the base management fee and performance fee to be paid, at the Adviser's election, in (i) cash, (ii) Class I shares of common stock ("" Class  I Shares ""), (iii) performance-contingent Class I Share awards ("" Class  I PCRs ""), or (iv) any combination of cash, Class I Shares or Class I PCRs. Under the New Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will be paid the base management fee and performance fee in cash unless it elects to receive Class I Shares or Class I PCRs by providing written notice to the Company within ten (10) days following the end of the applicable quarter or year when such fee was earned (the date of such election, the "" Election Date ""). Class I PCRs shall provide the Adviser the right to receive from the Company a number of Class I Shares equivalent to the number of Class I PCRs immediately upon satisfaction of the performance conditions set forth in the Class I PCR award agreement, which shall be approved by the Company's board of directors (the "" Board ""), including a majority of the independent directors, as fair and reasonable to the Company and on terms no less favorable to the Company than those available from unaffiliated third parties. The Adviser may elect at a later date to have the Company repurchase some or all of the Class I Shares issued to the Adviser in accordance with the New Advisory Agreement, including Class I Shares issued pursuant to any Class I PCRs (the "" Adviser Class  I Shares "") at a per share price equal to the then-current Class I Share transaction price (generally the prior month's net asset value ("" NAV "") per Class I Share). The Adviser Class I Shares will not be subject to the repurchase limits of the Company's share repurchase plan or any reduction or penalty for an early repurchase. The Adviser will have registration rights with respect to the Adviser Class I Shares.   In addition, Rialto Capital Management, LLC, the  sub-adviser  engaged by the Adviser (the "" Sub-Adviser ""), agreed to receive the base management fees and performance fees it receives from the Adviser in the same proportion of cash, Class I Shares and Class I PCRs as elected by the Adviser for a given period. Any such Class I Shares and Class I PCRs issued to the Sub-Adviser will have the same rights and conditions as those issued to the Adviser.   Form of Class I PCR Agreement    Under the form of Class I PCR agreement to be entered into between the Company, the Adviser and Sub-Adviser (the "" PCR Agreement ""), management and performance fees may be payable to the Adviser and Sub-Adviser (the "" Adviser Entities "") in the form of Class I PCRs to the extent that distributions paid to stockholders in the applicable fiscal quarter exceed the Company's Adjusted Core Earnings. "" Adjusted Core Earnings "" means: the net income (loss) attributable to stockholders, computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("" GAAP ""), including (A) realized gains (losses) not otherwise included in GAAP net income (loss), (B) stockholder servicing fees, and (C) reimbursements for organization and offering expenses, and excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) any unrealized gains or losses or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income for the applicable reporting period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income, and (iv) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain material non-cash income or expense items. Thereafter, Class I PCRs may become issuable in the form of Class I Shares upon the achievement of the following conditions in any fiscal quarter following the initial issuance of the Class I PCRs (together, the "" Performance Conditions ""): (a) Adjusted Core Earnings for the quarter exceed distributions paid to stockholders during such quarter (such difference, the "" Excess Distributable Income "") and (b) the annualized distribution yield on the Class I Shares (measured over such quarter) is at least at the yield target determined by management given then-current market conditions (the "" Yield Target ""). The initial Yield Target will be a 6.0% annualized yield on the Class I Shares.   On the last day of any fiscal quarter in which the Company achieves the Performance Conditions (the "" Performance Achievement Date ""), the Company will issue to the Adviser Entities the number of Class I Shares equal in value to the Excess Distributable Income for such quarter in respect of any outstanding Class I PCRs. The Adviser Entities, and their respective affiliates and employees, may not request repurchase by the Company of any Class I Shares issued under the PCR Agreement for a period of six (6) months from the date of issuance. Thereafter, upon ten (10) days' written notice to the Company by the Adviser Entities, the Company must repurchase any Class I Shares requested to be repurchased by the Adviser at the most recently published transaction price per Class I Share; provided that no repurchase shall be permitted that would jeopardize the Company's qualification as a REIT or violate Maryland law. If, prior to the Performance Achievement Date, (i) the New Advisory Agreement is terminated            in accordance with Section 12(b) of the New Advisory Agreement (other than Section 12(b)(iii) thereof) or (ii) the Sub-Advisory Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 9(b) thereof (other than Section 9(b)(v) thereof), any rights related to the Class I PCRs evidenced hereby by the terminated party as of the date of such termination shall immediately vest and the Company shall issue the number of Class I shares issuable upon such vesting. If, prior to the Performance Achievement Date, either of the Adviser Entities resigns as the adviser or sub-adviser, respectively, of the Company, then any rights related to the Class I PCRs evidenced hereby as of the date of such resignation shall remain outstanding and Class I Shares issuable in respect thereof shall be issued upon achievement of the Performance Conditions.",FALSE
"   This Form 8-K updates the Annual Report on Form 10-K of DDR Corp. (the Company) for the year ended December 31, 2011, which was filed on February 28, 2012 and was amended on

March 26, 2012 to amend Item 15 to include the separate financial statements of Sonae Sierra Brazil BV SARL, as required under Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X (the Form 10-K as previously amended, the Original Report).

This Form 8-K reflects the impact of the classification of discontinued operations of properties sold after January 1, 2012,

pursuant to the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification No. 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment (ASC 360), for the five years ended December 31, 2011. During the period January 1, 2012 to June 30, 2012, the

Company disposed of 17 shopping center properties and four office properties and had one property held for sale at June 30, 2012, aggregating 2.7 million square feet. In compliance with ASC 360, the Company has reported revenues, expenses

and losses and/or gains on the disposition of these properties as income (loss) from discontinued operations for each period presented in the Companys quarterly report or quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed since the properties were disposed

of (including the comparable period of the prior year). The same retrospective adjustment of discontinued operations required by ASC 360 is required for previously issued annual financial statements if those financial statements are incorporated by

reference in subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 even though those financial statements related to periods prior to the date of the sale.

Accordingly, the Company has reflected these retrospective adjustments in the following portions of the Original Report:

Item 6  Selected Financial Data, Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 8  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (including

the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm) and has reissued the

Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for the three years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.    All other

items of the Original Report remain unchanged, and no attempt has been made to update matters in the Original Report, except to the extent expressly provided above. Refer to the Companys quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for periods subsequent to

December 31, 2011.   ",FALSE
"   VASCO regularly sells products through third party distributors, resellers and integrators

(collectively Resellers). VASCOs standard terms and conditions of sale and template agreements that are in general use prohibit sales and exports of any VASCO products contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including United

States export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations. VASCO, however, does not always have visibility over its Resellers ultimate customers.

VASCO management has recently become aware that certain of its products which were sold by a VASCO European subsidiary to a third-party distributor may have

been resold by the distributor to parties in Iran, potentially including parties whose property and interests in property may be blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13224, Executive Order 13382 or that may be identified under Section 560.304 of

31 C.F.R. Part 560 as the Government of Iran.    The Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors has initiated an internal

investigation to review this matter with the assistance of outside counsel. VASCO has stopped all shipments to such distributor pending the outcome of the investigation which will include a review and recommendations to improve, if necessary,

VASCOs applicable compliance procedures regarding these matters. As a precautionary matter, concurrent initial notices of voluntary disclosure were submitted on June 25, 2015 with each of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of

Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS). The Company will file a further report with each of OFAC and BIS after completing its review and fully intends to

cooperate with both agencies. Total VASCO revenues from all sales to the particular distributor during the period relevant to review by OFAC and BIS (June 1, 2010 through June 25, 2015) were approximately $3.1 million.

OFAC and BIS will review the results of the Companys investigation when it is submitted. Following that review, OFAC and BIS may conclude that the

disclosed sales resulted in violations of U.S. economic sanctions and/or export control laws and warrant the imposition of civil penalties, such as fines, limitations on the Companys ability to export products from the United States, and/or

referral for further investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice. While the filing of a voluntary disclosure may be a mitigating factor in consideration of any penalties by these agencies, any resulting fines or restrictions may nonetheless be

material to the Companys financial results in the period in which they are imposed, but at this time the Company is not able to estimate the possible loss or range of loss in connection with this matter. Additionally, disclosure of this

conduct and any fines or other action relating to this conduct could harm the Companys reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. The Company cannot predict when OFAC and BIS will

conclude their own review of our voluntary self-disclosures or whether they may impose any penalties.

"  OneSpan is providing an update to our financial guidance and targets. We now expect that fiscal year 2023 revenue will be at the high end of the previously disclosed range of $228 million to $232 million, and that fiscal year 2023 adjusted EBITDA will achieve or exceed the high end of the previously disclosed range of $2 million to $4 million. In addition, we are reiterating our fiscal year 2023 ARR guidance of $148 million to $152 million, fiscal year 2024 revenue target of low- to mid-single digits growth over 2023 revenue and fiscal year 2024 adjusted EBITDA margin target of 20% to 23%. During 2024, we plan to continue to focus on improving our operating model, driving toward the aspirational goal of attaining a level of 30% under the ""Rule of 40"" framework by the time we exit 2024.   We expect a cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments balance of $41 million to $43 million at year-end 2023. Changes in cash during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 include payments to repurchase our common stock related to the $25 million modified Dutch auction tender offer we completed on December 18, 2023, restructuring payments, capitalized expenditures and changes in net working capital items. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and the Rule of 40 framework are non-GAAP metrics. We are not providing a reconciliation of guidance or targets for adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin or Rule of 40 to GAAP net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, because we are unable to predict certain items included in GAAP net income without unreasonable efforts.  We report financial results in accordance with GAAP. We also evaluate our performance using certain non-GAAP financial metrics, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and the Rule of 40 framework. Our management believes that these non-GAAP measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial metrics, provide useful supplemental information regarding the performance of our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are not measures of performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives or substitutes for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful for the purposes described below, they have limitations associated with their use, since they exclude items that may have a material impact on our reported results and may be different from similar measures used by other companies. Definitions We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, long-term incentive compensation, restructuring and other related charges, and certain non-recurring items, including acquisition related costs, lease exit costs, rebranding costs, and non-routine shareholder matters. We use adjusted EBITDA as a simplified measure of performance for use in communicating our performance to investors and analysts and for comparisons to other companies within our industry. As a performance measure, we believe that adjusted EBITDA presents a view of our operating results that is most closely related to serving our customers. By excluding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, long-term incentive compensation, impairment of intangible assets, restructuring costs, and certain other non-recurring items, we are able to evaluate performance without considering decisions that, in most cases, are not directly related to meeting our customers' requirements and were either made in prior periods (e.g., depreciation, amortization, long-term incentive compensation, non-routine shareholder matters), deal with the structure or financing of the business (e.g., interest, one-time strategic action costs, restructuring costs, impairment charges) or reflect the application of regulations that are outside of the control of our management team (e.g., taxes). In addition, removing the impact of these items helps us compare our core business performance with that of our competitors. We define adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue for a specified period. We define the Rule of 40 as the sum of (i) our adjusted EBITDA margin for a specified period plus (ii) our year-over-year revenue growth rate, expressed as a percentage, for the same period. For example, a Rule of 40 attainment level of 30% would mean that the sum of our adjusted EBITDA margin for a specified period plus the year-over-year revenue growth rate for that period would equal 30%. We use the Rule of 40 as a financial framework because it is a well-known framework in our industry, and therefore helpful to our investors; it allows us to measure our progress in achieving a balance between adjusted EBITDA margins and revenue growth; and it enables us to measure our financial performance against those of our peers.

" Agreement and Plan of Merger On August 18, 2023, Skye Bioscience, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the ""Company"" or ""Skye""), completed the acquisition of Bird Rock Bio, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Bird Rock""), in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated August 15, 2023 (the ""Merger Agreement""), by and among the Company, Aquila Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (""Merger Sub"") and Bird Rock. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Bird Rock, with Bird Rock surviving such merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the ""Merger""). The Merger is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the ""Effective Time""), the Company issued to certain former stockholders of Bird Rock, an aggregate of 968,973,005 shares of the common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (the ""Common Stock""), valued at approximately $20.0 million based on the 60 trading day volume weighted average price of the Common Stock as of an agreed upon date. The Board of Directors of the Company (the ""Board"") approved the Merger Agreement and the related transactions, and the consummation of the Merger was not subject to approval of the Company's stockholders. Immediately following the Merger and the Financing (as defined below), there were approximately 3.08 billion shares of Common Stock outstanding, and the former equity holders of Bird Rock owned approximately 31.4% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Investors (as defined below) owned approximately 37.0% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, and the equity holders of Skye immediately prior to the Effective Time owned approximately 31.6% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. The Merger Agreement has been included to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company or Bird Rock. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants that the Company and Bird Rock made to each other as of specific dates. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made solely for purposes of the Merger Agreement between the Company and Bird Rock and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the Company and Bird Rock in connection with negotiating its terms, including being qualified by confidential disclosures exchanged between the parties in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement. Moreover, the representations and warranties may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality that may be different from what may be viewed as material to investors or securityholders, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the Company and Bird Rock rather than establishing matters as facts. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company's public disclosures. For the foregoing reasons, no person should rely on the representations and warranties as statements of factual information at the time they were made or otherwise. Lock-up Agreements Concurrently and in connection with the Merger and the Financing, (i) certain Bird Rock stockholders as of immediately prior to the Merger, (ii) certain of the stockholders, directors and officers of the Company as of immediately prior to the Merger, (iii) the Investors, and (iv) MFDI (as defined below) entered into lock-up agreements with the Company, pursuant to which each such holder will be subject to a one year lock-up on the sale or transfer of shares of Common Stock held by each such stockholder as of the closing of the Merger, including Common Stock received by Bird Rock stockholders in the Merger (the ""Lock-up Agreements""). Private Placement and Securities Purchase Agreement In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, on August 15, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the ""Purchase Agreement"") with certain investors (collectively, the ""Investors""), pursuant to which the Company sold to the Investors an aggregate of 581,383,799 shares of Common Stock (the ""PIPE Shares""), at a price of $0.02064041 per share, and accompanying warrants to purchase up to 581,383,799 of Common Stock (the ""PIPE Warrants""), for an aggregate purchase price of $12.0 million (the ""Financing""). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Company issued to certain former stockholders of Bird Rock, an aggregate of 557,159,474 shares of Common Stock as a result of the participation of such former stockholders or their respective affiliates in the Financing. The PIPE Warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of $0.02064041 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth therein. The PIPE Warrants have a term of ten years from the date of issuance. The PIPE Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis if there is no effective registration statement registering the shares of Common Stock underlying the PIPE Warrants. The closing of the Financing occurred on August 18, 2023. The Purchase Agreement includes certain covenants, including a limitation on the Company's use of the net proceeds from the Financing, and a limitation on subsequent equity sales by the Company. The Purchase Agreement has been included to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company or the Investors. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants that the Company and the Investors made to each other as of specific dates. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made solely for purposes of the Purchase Agreement between the Company and the Investors and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the Company and the Investors in connection with negotiating its terms, including being qualified by confidential disclosures exchanged between the parties in connection with the execution of the Purchase Agreement. Moreover, the representations and warranties may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality that may be different from what may be viewed as material to investors or securityholders, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the Company and the Investors rather than establishing matters as facts. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Purchase Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company's public disclosures. For the foregoing reasons, no person should rely on the representations and warranties as statements of factual information at the time they were made or otherwise. Convertible Note Purchase Agreement On August 15, 2023, the Company entered into a Secured Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the ""Note Purchase Agreement"") with MFDI, LLC (""MFDI""), pursuant to which the Company issued to MFDI (i) a secured convertible promissory note (the ""MFDI Note"") in the principal amount of $5.0 million and (ii) an accompanying warrant to purchase up to 85,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the ""MFDI Warrant""). The MFDI Note will mature on the earlier of (i) 12 months following the date of the issuance and (ii) five business days after the aggregate face value of the appellate bond for the judgment issued in the case entitled Wendy Cunning vs. Skye Bioscience, Inc. in the United Stated District Court for the Central District of California as Case No. 8:21-cv-00710-DOC-KES is reduced to less than $4,280,000, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The conversion rate for the MFDI Note will initially be $0.02064041 per share of Common Stock (the ""Conversion Rate""). The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 10.0% per year and all interest accrued under the MFDI Note will be payable quarterly within 30 days of the last day of each calendar quarter. During the term of the MFDI Note, MFDI will be permitted to convert the MFDI Note into shares of Common Stock at any time at the then applicable Conversion Rate. The Company may prepay the principal or interest outstanding under the MFDI Note at any time without penalty. The Note Purchase Agreement includes certain covenants, including a requirement for the Company to use its reasonable best efforts to grant MFDI a security in the Company's real property located at 9295 198 St, Langley Twp, BC V1M 3J9 Canada as collateral for the Company's obligations under the MFDI Note. The MFDI Warrant is exercisable at an exercise price of $0.02064041 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth therein. The MFDI Warrant has a term of ten years from the date of issuance. The MFDI Warrant may be exercised on a cashless basis. Registration Rights Agreement  On August 15, 2023, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Purchase Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the ""Registration Rights Agreement"") with certain investors, pursuant to which such holders of Company securities will have certain customary registration rights, including rights with respect to the filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act within 180 days from the date of the Registration Rights Agreement.

The case, entitled  Wendy Cunning vs Skye Bioscience, Inc. , was filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (the ""Cunning Lawsuit"").

" The Company is providing certain updates to its 2020-2021 reinsurance program, which was previously described in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 1, 2020 (the ""Reinsurance 8-K""). FNIC's 2020-2021 New Non-Florida Homeowners Quota Share Reinsurance FNIC entered into a new quota-share treaty with Anchor Re, a wholly-owned Arizona captive reinsurance subsidiary of SageSure LLP (""SageSure""), the non-affiliated managing general underwriter that writes FNIC's non-Florida homeowners business. The treaty became effective on July 1, 2020 and provides 50% quota-share reinsurance protection on in-force, new and renewal business through June 30, 2021, subject to certain limitations. The treaty arrangement is fully collateralized through Anchor Re. This treaty supplements the existing 50% profit-sharing agreement in place with SageSure. Thus, this treaty is not expected to have any impact on the pre-tax operating results of the Company, although the components of the combined ratio will be affected by the ceding of premiums, claims and commissions. The Company expects FNIC will receive statutory surplus relief from this new quota-share treaty. FNIC's 2020-2021 Florida Homeowners Quota-Share Reinsurance Benefitting from our long-term trading relationship with Swiss Re, FNIC finalized the renewal of its quota-share reinsurance program for 2020-2021 on FNIC's Florida homeowners book of business. The program became effective on July 1, 2020 on an in-force, new and renewal basis at terms generally consistent with the 2019-2020 treaty. The treaty continues to provide protection excluding named storms, and has been initially set at 10%, which is subject to certain limitations including, but not limited to, caps on losses associated with non-named storm catastrophe losses.  2020-2021 Excess of Loss Reinsurance Program As previously reported  in the Reinsurance 8-K, the Company agreed to the terms of its excess of loss reinsurance program for 2020-2021, which covers the Company's three insurance carriers.

"- Strategic Direction

The Board of Directors and the management of Bluetorch Inc. have created and implemented a revised business model for the company.  Management and Board of Directors have been reviewing all aspects of the business. The underlying objective of this evaluation was to ensure that the company pursues a business approach that has the potential of producing fundamental values for its shareholders.

The Directors and management have determined that as a Business Development Company, future investments will be focused on companies that have entry level positive cash flow financial statements. Additionally, the investments must have the potential for growth based on existing core factors, additional capital infusion if required and, if necessary, the introduction of an experienced management team that has a reasonable expectation of expanding the existing foundation.

While the Directors and management remain bullish on the extreme sports apparel sector, and Island Tribe in particular, management will be reviewing acquisition opportunities to include all consumer products categories to provide for a diversification in an expanded portfolio. The Board and management feel strongly that this new direction will both reduce the risk for the Company and its shareholders as well as provide the best opportunity for long-term shareholder value.

Consistent with this new strategy, the Company has identified and initiated discussions with several potential acquisition candidates.

The company will continue to provide funding for Island Tribe Inc., a subsidiary in which Bluetorch Inc. owns 51% of the common stock. Management remains confident in the prospects for this unique surf apparel label and its potential for continued growth.

Regarding two of the Companys subsidiaries, Total Sports Distribution Inc. and Unboxed Distribution Inc., the Board and management has determined that these investments are not in conformity with the new business model in terms of current and future profitability. Therefore, it has been determined that it is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders to continue the flow of capital to these two subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Company has written off its investments in these two subsidiaries.

Specifically, the Company has signed a mutual release agreement with its Bluetorch licensor which calls for the Companys subsidiary, Unboxed Distribution Inc., to cease the selling and marketing of Bluetorch apparel. In keeping with this agreement, the Company also agrees to change its corporate name by April 20, 2005.

Excess of Loss Reinsurance Treaties

21 st  Century

Holding Company's (the ""Company"", ""we"" or ""us"") wholly owned subsidiary,

Federated National Insurance Company (""Federated National""), has agreed upon the

terms of its excess of loss catastrophe reinsurance treaties for the 2009 - 2010

hurricane season. These treaties are designed to reimburse Federated National

for property losses under its homeowners' insurance policies resulting from

covered events in the State of Florida, the only state where Federated National

is currently writing property insurance at this time.  We utilize

reinsurance to reduce exposure to catastrophic risk and to help manage capital,

while lessening earnings volatility and improving shareholder return, and to

support the required statutory surplus requirements. Our catastrophe reinsurance

program has been designed to coordinate coverage provided under various treaties

with various retentions and limits.

Our

private excess of loss type treaties have a term of one year beginning July 1,

2009 continuing through June 30, 2010 and have provisions for prepaid automatic

reinstatement protection. These treaties are with reinsurers that currently have

an AM Best or Standard & Poors rating of A- or better with the exception of

one fully collateralized participant rated NR by AM Best.

The

estimated cost to the Company for these reinsurance products for the 2009 - 2010

hurricane season, inclusive of approximately $18.6 million payable to the

Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (""FHCF"") and the prepaid automatic premium

reinstatement protection will be approximately $53.3 million. The combination of

private and FHCF reinsurance treaties will afford approximately $446.3 million

of aggregate coverage with maximum first event coverage totaling approximately

$339.7 million. Our retention in connection with the first two covered events is

$5.0 million for each event.

The cost

and amounts of reinsurance are based on management's current analysis of

Federated National's exposure to catastrophic risk. Our data will be subjected

to exposure level analysis as of September 30, 2009. This analysis of our

exposure level in relation to the total exposures to the FHCF and excess of loss

treaties may produce changes in retentions, limits and reinsurance premiums as a

result of increases or decreases in our exposure level.

Administration of Florida

On June

Contract""). The Reimbursement Contract will reimburse Federated National for

covered property losses under its homeowners' insurance policies resulting from

hurricanes that cause damage in the State of Florida, the state in which

Federated National is currently writing these types of policies, through May 31,

2010.

On June

11, 2009, Federated National executed an Amended Addendum No. 2, Addendum No. 4

and Addendum No. 5 to the Reimbursement Contract between Federated National and

On November 12, 2019, Spire Missouri Inc.

The Bonds will bear interest at a rate of 2.84% per annum. The interest on the Bonds is payable semi-annually on the 15th day of May and November of each year. The Bonds are secured by a Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated as of February 1, 1945 (as amended and supplemented heretofore, the ""Mortgage""), under which UMB Bank & Trust, N.A. is the present Trustee. The Mortgage is supplemented by a Thirty-Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated November 12, 2019. The Bonds will rank equal in right to payment with all other first mortgage bonds issued under the Mortgage. Spire Missouri will use the proceeds from the sale of the Bonds to repay existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.

The Bond Purchase Agreement contains provisions similar to those in other supplemental indentures to the Mortgage, including, among other things, limitations on certain types of liens and the payment of dividends and other restricted payments. It also contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, payment defaults, covenant defaults and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. Generally, upon the occurrence of a completed default, the trustee may, and shall if directed by the holders of a majority of first mortgage bonds then outstanding under the Mortgage, accelerate the maturity of the bonds.

The Thirty-Fourth Supplemental Indenture provides that Spire Missouri may at its option redeem all or part of the Bonds at 100% of the principal amount of the Bonds to be redeemed, plus a ""make-whole amount"" determined for the redemption date with respect to such principal amount. The make-whole amount is an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments with respect to the called principal amount of the Bonds over the amount of such called principal, with the discounted value based on a discount factor equal to 0.50% over the yield to maturity of U.S. Treasury securities having a remaining average life comparable to the principal amount called for redemption. In addition, Spire Missouri may redeem the Bonds in whole at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Bonds beginning (i) August 15, 2029, and (ii) at any time if all or substantially all of its property subject to the Mortgage is taken by eminent domain or sold to a governmental body or its designee.

On October 22, 2010, HealthSpring, Inc. (the Company) and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an Amendment

and Restatement Agreement with certain lenders, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, and Bank of America,

N.A., as administrative agent (the Amendment and Restatement Agreement), pursuant to which the Companys existing

Credit Agreement dated February 11, 2010 (the Existing Credit Agreement) will be amended and restated as set forth in

the form of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement attached as Exhibit A to the Amendment and Restatement Agreement

(as amended and restated, the Restated Credit Agreement). Effective upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent

set forth in the Amendment and Restatement Agreement and the Restated Credit Agreement, including the closing of the

Companys acquisition of Bravo Health, Inc. (Bravo) (previously announced on August 26, 2010 and reported on the

Companys Current Report on Form 8-K on August 31, 2010), the Existing Credit Agreement will be amended and restated in

its entirety to provide for, among other things:

The continuation of the $175.0 million revolving credit facility provided under the Existing Credit

Agreement, including the $25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and the

$25.0 million sublimit for swingline loans (the Revolving Credit Facility)

The continuation of the term loan made under the Existing Credit Agreement, $166.3 million of which

was outstanding at September 30, 2010, as Existing Term Loan A

The making of a New Term Loan A in a principal amount of $180.0 million (New Term Loan A)

The making of a New Term Loan B in a principal amount of $200.0 million (New Term Loan B)

The Revolving Credit Facility, Existing Term Loan A, New Term Loan A, and New Term Loan B are sometimes referred to

herein as the Credit Facilities.

Borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement will accrue interest on the basis of either a base rate or LIBOR

plus, in each case, an applicable margin depending on the Companys total debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio

(initially 450 basis points for LIBOR borrowings under New Term Loan B and 375 basis points for LIBOR borrowings under

the other Credit Facilities). With respect to New Term Loan B indebtedness, the Restated Credit Agreement includes a

minimum LIBOR of 1.5%. The Company will also pay a commitment fee of 0.500% per annum, which may be reduced to 0.375%

per annum if the Companys total debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio is 0.75 to 1.0 or less, on the daily unused

portions of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature, the commitments thereunder will

terminate, and all amounts then outstanding thereunder will be payable on February 11, 2014.

Under the Restated Credit Agreement, Existing Term Loan A and New Term Loan A will be payable in quarterly

principal installments. Prior to June 30, 2013, each quarterly principal installment payable in respect of each of

Existing Term Loan A and New Term Loan A will be in an amount equal to 2.5% of the aggregate initial principal amount

of Existing Term Loan A or New Term Loan A, as the case may be, and for principal installments payable on June 30, 2013

and thereafter, that percentage will be increased to 3.75%. The entire outstanding principal balance of each of

Existing Term Loan A and New Term Loan A will be due and payable in full at maturity on February 11, 2015.

2

Under the Restated Credit Agreement, New Term Loan B will be payable in quarterly principal installments, each in

an amount equal to 0.25% of the aggregate initial principal amount of New Term Loan B. The entire outstanding

principal balance of New Term Loan B will be due and payable in full at maturity on the sixth anniversary of the

Restatement Effective Date (as defined in the Amendment and Restatement Agreement, which most likely will be the date

of the closing of the Bravo transaction).

The net proceeds from certain asset sales, casualty and condemnation events, and certain incurrences of

indebtedness (subject, in the cases of asset sales and casualty and condemnation events, to certain reinvestment

rights), and a portion of the net proceeds from equity issuances and, under certain circumstances, the Companys excess

cash flow, are required to be used to make prepayments in respect of loans outstanding under the Credit Facilities.

Loans under the Restated Credit Agreement will be secured by a first priority lien on substantially all assets of

the Company and its non-HMO subsidiaries, including a pledge by the Company and its non-HMO subsidiaries of all of the

equity interests in each of their domestic subsidiaries (including HMO subsidiaries).

The Restated

Credit Agreement also contains conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the Restated Credit

Agreement and to extensions of credit thereunder as well as representations, warranties, and covenants, including

financial covenants, customary for transactions of this type. Financial covenants include (i) a maximum total debt to

adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.25 to 1.00 (reducing to 2.00 at December 31, 2011 and 1.75 to 1.00 on June 30, 2012),

(ii) minimum net worth requirements for each HMO subsidiary calculated by reference to applicable regulatory

requirements, and (iii) maximum capital expenditures, in each case as more specifically provided in the Restated Credit

Agreement.

The Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default as well as restrictions on

undertaking certain specified actions including, among others, asset dispositions, acquisitions and other investments,

dividends, changes in control, issuance of capital stock, fundamental corporate changes such as mergers and

consolidations, incurrence of additional indebtedness, creation of liens, transactions with affiliates, and certain

subsidiary regulatory restrictions. Under the Restated Credit Agreement, the Company will be permitted to repurchase

$100.0 million of the Companys common stock in any calendar year (which annual amount increases as the Companys

leverage ratio improves). If an event of default occurs that is not otherwise waived or cured, the lenders may

terminate their obligations to make loans and other extensions of credit under the Restated Credit Agreement and the

obligations of the issuing banks to issue letters of credit and may declare the loans outstanding under the Restated

Credit Agreement to be due and payable.

The foregoing summary of the Restated Credit Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by

Restatement Agreement that is attached as  Exhibit 10.1  to this report and incorporated herein by reference.

We indicated that because of a petition initiated by us last month, the MnSPs board of directors agreed to call a special meeting of MnSP members on September 14, 2006. The purpose of the special meeting will be to vote on a resolution containing the terms of an offer that we made to MnSPs board of directors this past

spring which was later rejected (the Offer). In the Offer, we offered to purchase the assets of MnSP in exchange for, among other things, the issuance of capital units and cash to MnSP. If MnSPs members vote yes on the resolution at the special meeting, MnSPs board of directors will be authorized to sell the assets to us under the terms of the Offer and to negotiate an asset purchase agreement.  If MnSPs members vote no on the resolution at the special meeting, MnSPs board of directors will not have authorization to sell the assets to us and, consequently, will have full discretion to proceed in any direction it desires regarding the future  operations of MnSP.

ITEM 2.01. COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS. Pursuant to the
Agreement and Plan of Merger agreement dated as of January 31, 2007 (the
""Agreement""), between Global Beverage Solutions, Inc. (the ""Company""), its

Corp.""), Beverage Network of Maryland, Inc., a Florida corporation (""Acquiree"")
and Xtreme Beverage Network, Inc., a Nevada corporation (""Seller"") and as
approved by the Company's Board of Directors, the Merger Corp. acquired the
Acquiree which is now merged into the Merger Corp. and the Merger Corp. remains
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company deemed effective as of February 23,
2007. All of the common stock of the Acquiree previously owned by the Seller was
assigned to the Merger Corp. in exchange for the issuance of 60,500,000 shares
of its common stock issued by the Company together with a commitment to provide
financing and managerial expertise to the Merger Corp. (which now includes the
business and assets of the Acquiree).

above, in connection with the acquisition, the Company issued 60,500,000 shares
of its Common Stock, all of which were unregistered. For this issuance, the
Company relied on the exemptions from the registration requirements of the

We are filing the following information with the SEC for the purpose of updating certain aspects of our publicly disclosed descriptions of our business and risk factors.

 

Company Overview

 

We are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel phage therapeutics. Phage therapeutics use bacteriophages, a family of viruses, to kill pathogenic bacteria. Phages have powerful and highly selective mechanisms of action that permit them to target and kill specific bacteria. We believe that phages represent a promising means to treat bacterial infections, especially those that have developed resistance to current therapies, including the so-called multi-drug-resistant or “superbug” strains of bacteria.

 

The extensive use of antibiotics since the beginning of the modern antibiotics era in the 1940s has resulted in drug resistance among many disease-causing bacteria. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, resistance to antibiotics threatens to reverse many of the key medical advances of the last half-century. Examples of clinically important microbes that are rapidly developing resistance to available antimicrobials include bacteria that cause skin, bone, lung and bloodstream infections (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, or S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, or MRSA), pneumonia and lung infections in both community and hospital settings and cystic fibrosis, or CF, patients (e.g., A. baumanii, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae), meningitis (e.g., S. pneumonia ), urinary tract and gastrointestinal infections (e.g., E. coli and C. difficile ). As phages kill bacteria in ways entirely unlike the mechanisms used by traditional antibiotics, we believe that most multi-drug resistant bacteria will be susceptible to phage therapy. Furthermore, should resistant bacteria emerge or evolve, we believe it will remain possible to identify phages that can effectively kill these resistant bacteria.

 

Our goal is to be the leading developer of phage therapeutics. We are combining our expertise in the manufacture of drug-quality bacteriophages and our proprietary approach and expertise in identifying, characterizing and developing naturally occurring bacteriophages with that of collaboration partners in bacteriophage biology, synthetic biology and manufacturing, to develop state-of-the-art bacteriophage products. We are developing phage products to combat multi- or pan-drug-resistant bacterial pathogens, leveraging advances in sequencing and molecular biology. We have developed certain phage combinations that we believe maximize efficacy and minimize phage resistance. We currently have product candidates for the treatment of S. aureus infections, including MRSA, P. aeruginosa infections, and C. difficile infections.

 

Our lead product candidate is AB-SA01, for the treatment of S. aureus infections, including MRSA. We also have another product candidate in earlier stage development, AB-PA01 for the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections, and an additional discovery program, AB-CD01 for the treatment of C. difficile infections.

 

We are developing our phage product candidates using a proprietary discovery and development platform, which is designed for rapid identification, characterization and manufacturing of multiple phage therapeutics, allowing for real-time manufacturing of personalized phage cocktails following isolate screen and phage selection. Each product candidate combines several carefully chosen phages, which target a specific disease-causing bacteria such as S. aureus, Salmonella, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus, E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter, Streptococcus, and C. difficile. We believe that the combination of our platform, our manufacturing capability, our understanding of the regulatory and development requirements of bacteriophage therapeutics, and the clinical and scientific expertise of our collaboration partners may enable the rapid advancement of phage therapeutics through the clinic and the regulatory approval process.

 

 

 

 

In November 2015, our Australian subsidiary, AmpliPhi Australia Pty Ltd, entered into a clinical trial research agreement with the University of Adelaide and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, both in Adelaide, SA, Australia, to conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial titled “A Phase 1 Investigator Initiated Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Preliminary Effectiveness of AB-SA01 in Patients with Chronic Rhinosinusitis Associated with S. aureus infection”. The University of Adelaide sponsored the clinical trial while we supplied AB-SA01 and controlled the trial protocol. This clinical trial primarily measured the safety and tolerability of AB-SA01 and secondarily examined the presence of S. aureus and symptoms assessed by the patient as well as by the physician using standard questionnaires used by physicians to assess treatment efficacy. We enrolled nine patients in the trial, divided into three cohorts. The first cohort received a twice daily dose of AB-SA01 for seven days. The second cohort received the same dose twice daily for 14 days. The third cohort received a higher dose of AB-SA01 twice daily for 14 days. Patients were monitored an additional 30 days following their last day of treatment. In October 2016, we reported topline safety and tolerability results which demonstrated that AB-SA01 was well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events. In December 2016, we reported the final results from the Phase 1 trial. AB-SA01 met the trial’s primary endpoints of safety and tolerability and all nine patients enrolled in the study experienced a reduction in the quantity of S. aureus infecting their sinuses, with some patients showing complete eradication of the bacterial infection. A comparison of pre- and post-treatment endoscopic images showed symptomatic improvement, including reductions in mucosal edema, discharge and polyps. In February 2017, we held a telephonic meeting with the FDA during which we received positive feedback from the FDA regarding our previously submitted proposal to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial of AB-SA01 in chronic rhinosinusitis, or CRS, patients. We are evaluating whether or when to pursue the initiation of such Phase 2 trial, but we believe AB-SA01 is well-positioned for study in a Phase 2 trial in patients with CRS. In the official minutes from the meeting, the FDA acknowledged that phage therapy is an exciting approach to treatment of multidrug-resistant organisms and expressed a commitment to addressing the unique regulatory challenges that might arise during product development. The FDA further acknowledged that the clinical safety and effectiveness data collected during development, including from emergency case studies, could inform future discussions for clinical development and ultimately, the regulatory pathway to approval. The FDA indicated they were open for continued discussions and suggested various potential next steps.

 

In June 2013, we entered into a cooperative research and development agreement, or Research and Development Agreement, with the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command focusing on developing bacteriophage therapeutics to treat S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa infections. In 2016, under this Research and Development Agreement, we completed enrollment of a Phase 1 safety study of AB-SA01 for the treatment of wounds infected with S. aureus and we reported safety and tolerability results which demonstrated that AB-SA01 was well tolerated throughout the trial. No subject had a treatment-emergent adverse event, or TEAE, which was considered definitely or probably related to AB-SA01, and there were no severe or higher grade TEAEs, serious adverse events or discontinuation of treatment due to TEAEs. Additionally, all laboratory values and vital sign parameters were within normal ranges. Overall, treatment with AB-SA01 was well tolerated when administered topically to the intact skin of healthy adults.

 

Personalized Precision Medicine Applications

 

We believe our bacteriophage technology may have unique application in the area of personalized medicine. In particular, we believe our bacteriophage technology can be used to develop personalized, targeted therapies for patients who suffer from serious or life-threatening antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and who have limited or no other satisfactory treatment options. Moreover, we believe our ability to customize phage therapies for antibiotic-resistant infections, combined with the ability of bacteriophage to re-sensitize drug-resistant populations to antibiotics, represents what could be a powerful tool against the growing challenge of antibiotic-resistant infections. We have commenced a focused effort to develop precisely targeted and personalized bacteriophage therapies aimed at addressing the unmet medical need of serious or life-threatening antibiotic-resistant infections.

 

Under existing compassionate-use guidelines, we expect to provide personalized phage therapies to patients suffering from severe, multidrug-resistant, or MDR, infections who have failed prior therapies. We believe this strategic approach will not only provide potential benefit to patients to whom we are able to provide personalized phage therapies under the compassionate-use guidelines, but also provide the clinical data from these compassionate use cases that we expect to support the potential validation of the clinical utility of phage therapy and inform our future discussions with the FDA in 2018 or later on defining a potential path to market approval. We anticipate that we will initially make personalized phage therapies available in Australia, where we plan to collaborate with leading hospitals and key opinion leaders to identify and select eligible patients. We believe Australia has a favorable regulatory framework with respect to treating patients under compassionate use guidelines.

The Court retained jurisdiction solely for the purpose of adjudicating the anticipated application of plaintiff's counsel for an award of attorneys' fees and reimbursement of expenses in connection with the supplemental disclosures included in the December 3, 2018 Form S-4/A. The Company subsequently agreed to pay $190,000 to plaintiff's counsel for attorneys' fees and expenses in full satisfaction of the claim for attorneys' fees and expenses in the action. The Court has not been asked to review, and will pass no judgment on, the payment of the attorneys' fees and expenses or their reasonableness.   ",FALSE

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

      1. Acquisition of HemiWedge Intellectual Property. See Item 2.01 below.

      2. Facility Lease. On December 1, 2005, Shumate Machine Works, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Shumate Industries, entered into a lease agreement with
option to purchase for the lease of a manufacturing facility of approximately
60,000 square feet located in Conroe, Texas. Shumate will use these premises in
addition to the approximately 25,000 square feet that it currently leases in
Conroe. The new lease agreement is a three-year lease at a rate of approximately
$14,000 per month. The new lease agreement grants to Shumate Machine an option
to purchase the premises covered under the lease for a purchase price of
$1,825,000, against which amount Shumate Machine shall be entitled to a credit
against the purchase price in an amount equal to the amount necessary to
amortize the purchase price at seven percent (7%) over a period of 240 months.
The purchase option expires on September 1, 2009. Concurrently therewith, the
lessor of the property granted to Shumate Machine a right of first refusal with
respect to the premises. In addition, Shumate Machine entered into a sublease
agreement for the sublease of a portion of the premises to Modco Industries,
Inc. The sublease agreement is a three-month sublease, with automatic extensions
for the following 33 months, at a rate of approximately $4,000 per month.

Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

      On December 5, 2005, Shumate Industries, Inc., or Shumate, through its
newly-formed, wholly owned subsidiary, HemiWedge Valve Corporation, or HVC,
acquired the intellectual property rights to the HemiWedge(R) line of products,
including the HemiWedge(R) valve, from Soderberg Research and Development, Inc.
and certain of its affiliates. The HemiWedge(R) valve is a quarter-turn,
segmented metal seated valve, engineered to provide substantial technological
improvements compared with what is available in the marketplace today from
traditional butterfly, ball and gate valve designs. The intellectual property
rights acquired consist of all patents, trademarks, and internet website
relating to the HemiWedge(R) product line.

      The aggregate consideration paid for the intellectual property rights
consisted of $138,500.00 in cash and a two-year, six percent (6%) promissory
note in the principal amount of $100,000.00, payable in 24 equal installments of
principal and interest. In addition, HVC agreed to deposit (a) $72,000.00 into
an escrow account to be paid in the form of a monthly advance in the amount of
$3,000.00 for each month of the 24 month period beginning with the month
immediately following the closing date; and (b) three percent (3%) of the net
sales proceeds collected from customers from (i) gross revenue from sales of
products to which the acquired intellectual property relates, less (ii) sakes
and/or use taxes, import and/or export duties, outbound transportation costs,
and amounts allowed or credited due to returns, which payments shall begin two
years after the closing date and continue until March 29, 2013. The $72,000.00
in monthly advances shall be credited against the three percent (3%) of the net
sales proceeds.

      Shumate funded the cash portion of the purchase price with the proceeds of
a private placement by A. Earl Swift, Shumate's former director and a
significant stockholder of Shumate. Mr. Swift purchased 416,667 shares of
Shumate's common stock in the private placement at a purchase price of $0.60 per
share for gross proceeds of $250,000. Shumate relied on the exemption from
registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
for the offer and sale of the shares.

HemiWedge Valve Corporation

      HVC will operate as a separate division of Shumate. The HemiWedge division
intends to launch its new product line in the first half of 2006:

      o     Quarter-turn metal seated valves with bore sizes ranging from 2""
            thru 8"" 600# ANSI/API with custom sizes up to 24"";

      o     multiple pressure classes and materials of construction;

      o     targeting several market applications within oil and gas flow
            control; and

      o     ANSI and API certifications.

      The Hemiwedge(R) valve introduces new intellectual property to the
industry, including a top entry replacement cartridge design. Shumate believes
that the new patented design offers a longer lasting valve, especially in
severe/critical services and flow control application through protected sealing
surfaces, and it also believes that it will substantially reduces field down
time from its pre-certified replacement cartridge.

      The energy field services market is comprised of several market segments
including oil & gas field services, pipeline and transportation, process
controls, fluid management and controls, subsea, refining, and maintenance
services for these areas. According to the Valve Manufacturing Association, the
dollar size of the U.S. industrial valve market that the HemiWedge(R) valve
product line targets was $3.1 billion in 2004.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On July 31, 2023, pursuant to and in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended, the “Charter”) of Crixus BH3 Acquisition Company (the “Company”), the Company’s sponsor, Crixus BH3 Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”), has provided the Company with a 30 day extension notice (the “Extension Notice”) relating to the date by which the Company must complete an initial business combination (the “Termination Date”). In connection therewith, the Sponsor has deposited into the trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders (the “Trust Account”) an amount of $175,440.72 ($0.035 per outstanding share of the Company’s 5,012,592 shares of Class A common stock (“Offering Shares”)) (such amount, a “Deposit Amount”). The Deposit Amount shall be used to fund the redemption of the Offering Shares.

Accordingly, the Company has extended the Termination Date from August 7, 2023 to September 6, 2023 (the “New Termination Date”). In the event that the Company does not complete its initial business combination by the New Termination Date, the Company may further extend the New Termination Date by up to 5 additional 30-day periods if the Sponsor (i) provides the Company with an Extension Notice no later than 5 days prior to the New Termination Date (or such later 30 day period) and (ii) deposits an additional Deposit Amount into the Trust Account in connection with each such extension.

In connection with the above referenced extension, on July 31, 2023, the Company executed and delivered to the Sponsor a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note (the “Promissory Note”) equal to such Deposit Amount (which amount shall be increased by additional Deposit Amounts in connection with any subsequent 30 day extensions, up to a maximum of $1,052,644.32). The Promissory Note shall not be repaid by the Company in the event that the Company is unable to complete an initial business combination unless there are funds of the Company available outside of the Trust Account to do so. The foregoing description of the Note is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Note, a copy of which is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1, and is incorporated herein by reference.

While the Company has entered into a non-binding proposal (with a binding exclusivity agreement) with respect to a business combination, there will not be sufficient time to enter into a definitive agreement relating thereto and consummate the transactions contemplated thereby before August 7, 2023. No assurances can be made that the Company will successfully negotiate and enter into a definitive agreement regarding a business combination prior to the New Termination Date. In the event that the Company enters into a definitive agreement for a business combination prior to the New Termination Date, the Company will issue a press release and file a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission announcing the proposed business combination.

The Amendment established a new senior secured term loan “B” credit facility commitment in the amount of $510,250,000 (the ""Tranche B3 Loans""). The entirety of the new Tranche B3 Loans were borrowed by SAIC on the Closing Date, the proceeds of which were used to refinance all existing Tranche B Loans and Tranche B2 Loans outstanding immediately prior to giving effect to the Amendment.
The new Tranche B3 Loans will bear interest at a variable rate of interest based on the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""Term SOFR"") or a base rate, plus an applicable margin of 1.875% for Term SOFR loans and 0.875% for base rate loans. The new Tranche B3 Loans will amortize quarterly beginning on July 31, 2024 at 0.25% of the original borrowed amount thereunder with the remaining unamortized balance due in full upon maturity on February 08, 2031. In the event any portion of the Tranche B3 Loans is repaid prior to August 8, 2024 as a result of a ""Repricing Event"" (as defined in the Amendment), the Company will be required to pay a 1.00% fee of the amount repaid. After this initial six month period, the new Tranche B3 Loans may be prepaid at any time without penalty and are subject to the same mandatory prepayments, including from excess cash flow, as the Company’s prior term loans under the Existing Credit Agreement. The new Tranche B3 Loans are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Company’s wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, and is guaranteed by each of the Company’s wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. The new Tranche B3 Loans will be subject to the same covenants and events of default as the Company’s term loans under the Existing Credit Agreement.
The Sixth Amendment also contains certain other conforming amendments.

Entry into Material Definitive Agreement

On September 22, 2023 (the “Effective Date”), Capstone Green Energy Corporation (the “Company”) entered into a Sixth Amendment (the “Sixth Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement dated October 1, 2020 (the “A&R Note Purchase Agreement”) among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company, Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Group, L.P. (as successor in interest to Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Holdings, Inc.), as collateral agent (the “Collateral Agent”), and the purchaser party thereto (the “Purchaser”). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the A&R Note Purchase Agreement, as amended by the Sixth Amendment.

Pursuant to the Sixth Amendment, the Company issued and the Purchaser purchased for $3,000,000 in cash additional senior secured notes on the Effective Date (the “Additional Notes”). The Additional Notes bear interest at the SOFR Rate plus 8.75% per annum, payable-in-kind on the last day of each interest period of one-, two-, three- or six-months (but, in the case of a six-month interest period, every three-months). The entire principal amount of the Additional Notes is due and payable on September 1, 2024 (the “Maturity Date”). The Additional Notes do not amortize and the entire principal balance is due in a single payment on the Maturity Date.

The Company’s obligations under the A&R Note Purchase Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries and secured by a lien on substantially all of the present and future property and assets of the Company and such subsidiaries, in each case, subject to customary exceptions and exclusions.

The Additional Notes issued on the Effective Date and the related guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act, and have been offered and sold in reliance on the exemption from the registration provided by Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. The Additional Notes and the related guarantees may not be offered or sold in the United States without registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.

The Company plans to use the proceeds of the Additional Notes to fund its ongoing operations. The Company is continuing to work with the Collateral Agent and the Purchaser toward a definitive near-term resolution of its financing issues that will strengthen its balance sheet and that will benefit the Company’s stakeholders, including its vendors and other creditors and its stockholders. Such resolution remains subject to a number of factors, including negotiation of definitive documentation, and no assurance can be given that these efforts will conclude successfully.

●        The fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 (the “Subject Periods”).
The Company currently intends to file the restated financial statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) as soon as practicable after the Audit Committee’s ongoing review is complete, the restated financial statements are complete and have been audited or reviewed by Marcum LLP (“Marcum”), the Company’s independent registered accounting firm, and the required periodic reports are finalized.


“Bill and hold” sales generally are sales meeting specified criteria under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) to recognize revenue at the time title to goods is transferred to the customer, even though the seller does not ship the goods to the customer until a later time. In typical sales transactions other than those accounted for as bill and hold, title to goods is transferred to the customer at the point of shipment or delivery. As a result of a review concerning the Subject Periods, conducted with the assistance of independent advisors, the Audit Committee identified numerous instances where bill and hold transactions did not appear to meet the requirements for revenue recognition under GAAP. As a result, the Audit Committee has concluded that, in most such cases, revenue should not have been recognized until a later time when the products were subsequently shipped to the customer. As a result, the revenue and the related cost of goods sold reported by the Company for each of the Subject Periods does not accurately reflect the revenue earned in such periods.


The restatement of the financial statements has not been completed, and the full impact of the errors on the Company’s previously filed financial statements has not yet been determined.


Due to the impact of the above matters on the presentation of the Company’s financial statements in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 and in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company has not timely filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 or its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2023 with the SEC, and may not timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2023. The Company’s ongoing negotiations with the Collateral Agent and the Purchaser also contributed to the delays in filing its Annual Report and Quarterly Report.


As part of the consideration of the above-described matters, the Company has and will continue to assess the underlying internal control deficiencies that allowed these issues to go undetected and will provide its conclusion regarding control deficiencies and remedial measures in the filings referenced in this Item 4.02.


The Audit Committee has discussed the matters described in this Item 4.02 with Marcum.
