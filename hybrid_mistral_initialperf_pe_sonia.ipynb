Share Repurchase Program  The Company announced today the acceleration of its capital return plan with a $150 million share repurchase plan effective through the end of 2016 that was approved by the Companys Board of Directors.  The Company currently intends to repurchase its shares over time through a combination of the tender offer referred to below and open market purchases, and may also repurchase shares through private transactions, exchange offers, additional tender offers or other means. The Company intends to fund this program using its working capital.  Modified Dutch Auction Tender Offer  Under the new share repurchase program, the Company announced that it plans to launch promptly a modified Dutch auction tender offer to purchase up to $75 million of its common stock, at a price per share of not less than $8.50 and not greater than $9.25.  The tender offer will be contingent upon satisfaction of customary conditions. Additional details regarding the pricing and other terms will be provided upon formal commencement of the tender offer.  The Company had approximately 117.4 million shares of common stock outstanding as of October 28, 2015.  2  Information Regarding the Planned Tender Offer  This description is for informational purposes only and is not an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell any shares of the Companys common stock. The planned tender offer described in this Item 8.01 has not yet commenced, and there can be no assurance that the Company will commence the tender offer on the terms described in this Item 8.01 or at all. If the Company commences the tender offer, the tender offer will be made solely by an Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal, as they may be amended or supplemented.  Stockholders and investors are urged to read any Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO filed by the Company with the SEC in connection with the tender offer including the Offer to Purchase, the related Letter of Transmittal and other offer materials and exhibits thereto, as well as any amendments or supplements to the Schedule TO when they become available, because they will contain important information. If the Company commences the tender offer, it will file each of the documents referenced in this paragraph with the SEC, and, when available, investors may obtain them for free from the SEC at its website (www.sec.gov) or from the Companys information agent engaged in connection with the tender offer.  Note Regarding Share Repurchase Program  The Companys announcement of its share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of its shares of common stock. The Company will determine when, if and how to proceed with any repurchase transactions under the program, as well as the amount of any such repurchase transactions, based upon, among other things, the results of the tender offer and the Companys evaluation of its liquidity and capital needs (including for strategic and other opportunities), its business, results of operations, and financial position and prospects, general financial, economic and market conditions, prevailing market prices for the Companys shares of common stock, corporate, regulatory and legal requirements, and other conditions and factors deemed relevant by the Companys management and Board of Directors from time to time. The share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. There can be no assurance as to the actual volume of share repurchases in any given period or over the term of the program, if any, or as to the manner or terms of any such repurchases. The information in this Item 8.01 does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities in any jurisdiction.\",\n",

Each Note has a scheduled maturity date of one year from the date of issuance, except that the Note issued to one lender that is not, and is not affiliated with, a director of the Company has a scheduled maturity date of six months from the date of issuance. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 13.8% per annum, payable at maturity. The Company may prepay the Notes at any time without premium or penalty, and the Notes do not restrict the incurrence of future indebtedness by the Company.    In the event that the Company fails to timely pay amounts due under the Notes or the Company materially defaults in its performance of any other covenant under the Notes or the Security Agreement (as defined below), which default is not cured within 30 days after written notice thereof, then at the option of the lenders, upon the written consent of lenders representing a majority of the outstanding and unpaid principal under the Notes, all unpaid principal, accrued interest and other amounts owing under the Notes shall be immediately due and payable.    In the event that the Company files any petition or action for relief under any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency or moratorium law or any other law for the relief of or relating to debtors, or makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors or takes any corporate action in furtherance thereof, or if an involuntary petition is filed against the Company (unless such petition is dismissed or discharged within 60 days) under any bankruptcy statute, or a custodian, receiver, trustee, assignee for the benefit of creditors is appointed to take possession, custody or control of any property of the Company, then all unpaid principal, accrued interest and other amounts owing under the Notes will accelerate and automatically become immediately due and payable.    The Notes are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company, excluding the Company's intellectual property.

The forgoing descriptions of the Notes and the Security Agreements do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, the form of Note and form of Security Agreement filed hereto as Exhibits 4.1 and 10.1, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.  \",\n",

The Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (expiring in September 2019) pursuant  to which the Company is permitted to borrow up to an aggregate of $500 million (the Credit Facility), which is available to fund permitted acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement replaces and refinances the  Companys Prior Credit Agreement (as defined below). The Companys ability to draw on the Credit Facility is subject to customary conditions.  Interest is payable at the end of each interest period chosen by the Company or, at the latest, each six months. The interest rate is LIBOR plus a margin  factor initially set at 2.75%. The margin factor is subject to variation (ranging from 2.50% to 3.25%) in the event of a change to the Companys long term senior unsecured debt rating assigned by Standard & Poors Ratings Services  or Fitch Ratings Ltd. Any unused portion of the Credit Facility will be subject to a commitment fee of 35% of the applicable margin factor. The Credit Facility imposes various financial and business covenants on the Company and its subsidiaries,  including certain limitations on mergers and consolidations, acquisitions, indebtedness and guarantees, restrictions as to dispositions of stock and assets, and limitations on liens.  During the existence of any event of default (as specified in the Credit Agreement), the agent may cancel the commitments of the lenders, declare all or a  portion of outstanding amounts immediately due and payable or declare all or a portion of outstanding amounts payable upon demand. During the existence of any payment default, the interest rate would be increased by 1.0%. The Credit Facility  terminates and all amounts borrowed must be repaid on the fifth anniversary of the date of the Credit Agreement.    The foregoing description of the Credit  Agreement is qualified by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.    The  Credit Agreement refinances and replaces, in its entirety, the Companys Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, originally dated June 14, 2011, as amended from time to time, and as amended and restated pursuant to the Restatement Agreement,  dated July 8, 2013, among the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, NAB and Barclays, as mandated lead arrangers, NAB, Barclays and RBC, as original lenders, and NAB as agent (the Prior Credit Agreement). The Prior Credit  Agreement had permitted the Company to borrow up to an aggregate of $375 million on a secured basis over a five-year term (the Prior Credit Facility). Effective September 16, 2014 and concurrent with its entry into the Credit  Agreement, the Company terminated the Prior Credit Agreement. Outstanding borrowings under the Prior Credit Facility totaled $319.6 million and were refinanced on September 16, 2014 with borrowings pursuant to the Credit Facility.  The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Prior Credit Agreement and no material early termination fees were incurred in connection with the  termination.    The Prior Credit Facility had been secured by a first priority lien on the stock of certain of the Companys subsidiaries and certain  bank accounts held with Barclays in the name of the Company and into which amounts received in respect of any capital release from certain of the Companys subsidiaries were required to be paid. In connection with the termination of the Prior  Credit Agreement, all security pursuant to the Prior Credit Facility has been released, effective September 16, 2014.  \",\n",

The properties to be acquired have an estimated current net production of  approximately 10 MBoepd from 44 horizontal and 326 vertical producing wells. Based on the estimates of the Companys internal reserve engineers, the Company estimates that there were approximately 43 MMBoe of proved reserves associated with  these properties as of June 30, 2016, of which 69% were proved developed. These reserve estimates were made in accordance with current SEC rules and regulations regarding oil and natural gas reserve reporting, including using average  first-day-of-the-month prices for the prior 12 months in accordance with SEC guidelines.

As a result, the conversion rate for the Company's unsecured convertible promissory notes due 2023 was adjusted from 48.3294 shares per $1,000 principal amount to 48.9758 shares per $1,000 principal amount. This adjustment represents an adjusted conversion price of approximately $20.4182 per share. The information provided is not considered filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor is it subject to liabilities under that section. It is also not incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, unless specifically referenced in such a filing.\",\n",
        "    \" On March 14, 2018, the Company completed the public offering of the Notes pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement. The net proceeds of the offering of the Notes were approximately $248.8 million after deducting the underwriting discount and the Company's estimated offering expenses. The Company expects that the net proceeds from the offering will be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of a portion of the amounts outstanding under the Company's unsecured revolving credit facility.  The offering of the Notes was made pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-220479), which became effective upon filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"\"SEC\"\") on September 15, 2017, including a prospectus, dated September 15, 2017, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement, dated March 12, 2018, which was filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) under the Securities Act.  The legal opinion of the Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of the Company relating to the offering of the Notes pursuant to the Registration Statement is filed as Exhibit 5.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.  The Company issued the Notes pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of November 29, 2017 (the \"\"Base Indenture\"\"), as amended and supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 14, 2018 (the \"\"Second Supplemental Indenture\"\" and, together with the Base Indenture, the \"\"Indenture\"\"),  in each case by and between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the \"\"Trustee\"\").  Interest on the Notes will be paid quarterly in cash in arrears on March 12, June 12, September 12 and December 12 of each year, beginning on June 12, 2018, at a rate equal to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate plus 55 basis points. The Notes will mature on March 12, 2020. The Notes are not redeemable.  The Indenture contains covenants, including that, subject to certain exceptions, the Company and its subsidiaries may not grant liens on any property of the Company or its subsidiaries, unless the Notes are secured by liens on an equal and ratable basis to those granted to such other creditors. The Company may issue additional debt securities ranking equally with, and otherwise similar in all respects to, the Notes (except for the public offering  price, the issue date and the first interest payment date, if applicable) so that those additional debt securities will be consolidated and form a single series with the Notes without the consent of the holders of the Notes.  The Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes may require the Company to repay the entire principal amount of the Notes, including any premium and any interest, immediately upon the occurrence of the following events of default: (1) failure to pay any interest on the Notes within 30 days after the same becomes due and payable; (2) failure to pay the principal of or premium, if any, or any payment required by sinking or analogous fund, on the Notes when it becomes due and payable; and (3) failure to observe or perform any of our covenants or agreements applicable to the Notes for 60 days after notice of failure, either from the Trustee or from holders of at least 25% of the principal amount outstanding of the Notes. Upon the occurrence of certain events of receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company, all unpaid principal of, any premium and any accrued interest on the Notes will become automatically due and payable immediately, without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holder.  The foregoing description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of each of the Base Indenture and the Second Supplemental Indenture, including the form of the Note, copies of which are attached or incorporated by reference herein as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated by reference herein.      \",\n",
        "    \"  On October 1, 2010, Enstar Group Limited (the Company) entered into share repurchase  agreements (the Repurchase Agreements) with three of its executives and certain trusts and a  corporation affiliated with them to repurchase an aggregate of 800,000 ordinary shares of the  Company at a price of $70.00 per share. The aggregate purchase price of $56,000,000 is payable by  the Company through promissory notes to each selling shareholder (each, a Promissory Note).  The Company agreed to repurchase an aggregate of 600,000 ordinary shares from Dominic F.  Silvester and R&H Trust Co. (NZ) Limited, as trustee of the Left Trust (the Left Trust). Mr.  Silvester is the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Mr.  Silvester and his immediate family are the sole beneficiaries of the Left Trust. Mr. Silvesters  beneficial ownership interest in the Company will be reduced from approximately 15.6% to 11.9% as a  result of the repurchase. The sales by Mr. Silvester are designed to reduce his holdings below 10%  after taking into consideration the 2,972,892 shares of nonvoting convertible ordinary shares of  the Company held by one of its subsidiaries (which shares are not considered to be outstanding for  financial reporting purposes). Mr. Silvester has informed the Company that he intends to become a  resident of the United States during 2011 or 2012, which will make Mr. Silvester a U.S. person  for purposes of the subpart F rules under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Under those rules, if  one or more U.S. persons that each own, directly or by attribution, 10% or more of a foreign  corporations outstanding shares, measured by voting power, own in the aggregate more than 25% of  the foreign corporations outstanding shares, by vote or value, the corporation will be a  controlled foreign corporation with respect to insurance income  which is generally defined  as insurance company income from insuring risks located outside its country of incorporation. In  that case, those U.S. shareholders must include in their taxable income each year their pro rata  share of the controlled foreign corporations insurance income even if that income is not  distributed. A substantial amount of the income normally earned by the Companys non-U.S.  subsidiaries that are insurance companies constitutes insurance income as so defined.  The Company believes that the nonvoting shares owned by its subsidiary do not affect the  determination whether the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a controlled foreign corporation,  and that the Companys bye-law restriction that caps any U.S. persons voting power with respect to  Company shares at 9.5% of the total voting power, coupled with pass-through voting for directors of  the Companys foreign subsidiaries, has operated and will continue to operate to preclude any U.S.  person from owning, directly or by attribution, more than 10%, measured by voting power, of the  shares of the Company or any of its foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Company believes that  the ownership of 10% or more of its ordinary shares by a U.S. person should not cause the Company  or any of its subsidiaries to be controlled foreign corporations. Nonetheless, it is possible that  Internal Revenue Service might disagree with these positions. Therefore, the Company believes it  is prudent to avoid a circumstance in which U.S. persons that own 10% or more of its outstanding  shares, by vote or value, own in the aggregate more than 25% of its outstanding shares. Because  the Companys subsidiary that owns the nonvoting convertible ordinary shares is a U.S. person, any  negative tax consequences from the Company becoming a controlled foreign corporation might impact  that subsidiary  and, hence, the Company, as well as Mr. Silvester. By repurchasing the shares  from Mr. Silvester, the Company eliminates any such tax exposure that might otherwise have resulted  from his move to the United States.  The Company also agreed to repurchase 100,000 of its ordinary shares from R&H Trust Co. (BVI)  Limited, as trustee of the Elbow Trust (the Elbow Trust). Paul J. OShea (the Companys Joint  Chief Operating Officer, Executive Vice President and a member of its Board of Directors) and his  immediate family are the sole beneficiaries of the Elbow Trust. In addition, the Company agreed to  repurchase 100,000 of its ordinary shares from Hove Investments Holding Limited (Hove). Nicholas  A. Packer (the Companys Joint Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President) and his  immediate family are the sole beneficiaries of a trust that is the sole owner of Hove. While the  shares held by Messrs. OShea and Packer do not present the same tax issues as Mr. Silvesters  holdings, the Company believed it was fair and appropriate to offer each of them, as Mr.  Silvesters co-founders of the Company, the opportunity to sell shares back to the Company on the  same terms offered to Mr. Silvester.  Closing of the repurchase transactions is expected to occur as soon as practicable. At the  closing, the Company will issue a Promissory Note to Mr. Silvester in the principal amount of  $4,789,260 and to the Left Trust in the principal amount of $37,210,740. The Company will issue  Promissory Notes to both the Elbow Trust and  2  Hove in the principal amount of $7,000,000. The annual interest rate for the notes is fixed at  3.5% and the notes are repayable in three equal installments on December 31, 2010, December 1, 2011  and December 1, 2012. The holders may accelerate amounts payable under the Promissory Notes upon  the Companys default in payment, a sale of all or substantially all of the Companys assets,  formal action in contemplation of the Companys dissolution or liquidation or the institution of  bankruptcy proceedings. The Company may prepay the Promissory Notes in whole or in part at any  time without premium or penalty.  In connection with the Repurchase Agreements, the Company will enter into lock-up agreements  with each of Messrs. Silvester, OShea and Packer, the Left Trust, the Elbow Trust, Hove, and a  separate trust of which Mr. Silvester and his immediate family are the sole beneficiaries. The  lock-up agreements prohibit future sales and transfers of shares now owned or subsequently acquired  for two years from the date of the Repurchase Agreements.  The Repurchase Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby were approved by the  Companys Audit Committee, which consists solely of its independent directors, on September 30,  2010. The closing price of the Companys ordinary shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on  September 29, 2010 was $72.11. The descriptions of the Repurchase Agreements are qualified in  their entirety by reference to the full text of the agreements, which are filed as Exhibits 10.1,  10.2 and 10.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.  In addition to the repurchases by the Company, Messrs. OShea and Packer have also entered  into agreements to sell 32,500 shares each at $70.00 per share to certain investment funds  affiliated with Akre Capital Management, LLC. Charles T. Akre, a member of the Companys Board of  Directors, is the managing member of Akre Capital Management, LLC. Mr. OSheas beneficial  ownership interest in the Company will be reduced from approximately 4.6% to 3.9% as a result of  the two transactions. Mr. Packers beneficial ownership interest in the Company will be reduced  from approximately 4.4% to 3.7% as a result of the two transactions.\",\n",

        "    \"On August 26, 2020, Enstar Group Limited (the \"\"Company\"\") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Enstar Finance LLC (\"\"Enstar Finance\"\"), completed a previously-announced underwritten public offering (the \"\"Offering\"\") of $350 million aggregate principal amount of 5.750% Fixed-Rate Reset Junior Subordinated Notes due 2040 (the \"\"Junior Subordinated Notes\"\"). The Junior Subordinated Notes were issued by Enstar Finance and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a junior subordinated basis, by the Company. In connection with the Offering, on August 26, 2020, the Company, Enstar Finance and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the \"\"Trustee\"\"), entered into a first supplemental indenture (the \"\"First Supplemental Indenture\"\") to the junior subordinated indenture, dated as of August 26, 2020 (the \"\"Junior Subordinated Indenture\"\"). The Junior Subordinated Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture set forth the terms and conditions of the Junior Subordinated Notes, including customary events of default and the rights and obligations of the parties thereto and the holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes. Copies of the Junior Subordinated Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture are filed as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2 hereto, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference. The Junior Subordinated Notes will bear interest (a) from the date of original issue to, but excluding, September 1, 2025 at the fixed rate of 5.750% per annum and (b) from, and including, September 1, 2025, during each five-year period thereafter, at a rate per annum equal to the Five-Year Treasury Rate as of two business days prior to the beginning of such five-year period plus 5.468% as reset at the beginning of each such five-year period. Interest will be paid on September 1 and March 1 of each year, commencing on March 1, 2021. If, as of any interest payment date, a Mandatory Deferral Event (as defined below) has occurred and is continuing, Enstar Finance and the Company will be required to defer payment of all (and not less than all) of the interest accrued on the Junior Subordinated Notes as of such interest payment date. A \"\"Mandatory Deferral Event\"\" will be deemed to have occurred if the Company or all of its subsidiaries that are regulated insurance or reinsurance companies (or part of such regulatory group) are in breach of the enhanced capital and surplus requirements under applicable insurance supervisory laws (the \"\"Enhanced Capital Requirements\"\"), or would breach such Enhanced Capital Requirement if payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes, together with any accrued and unpaid interest on any junior subordinated notes outstanding that rank equally in right of payment with the Junior Subordinated Notes, were made. The Junior Subordinated Notes are scheduled to mature on September 1, 2040, if, on such date, certain redemption requirements are satisfied, or otherwise, following such scheduled maturity date, the earlier of (a) the date falling ten business days after the redemption requirements are satisfied and would continue to be satisfied if such payment were made and (b) the date on which a winding-up of the Company or Enstar Finance occurs (the \"\"Final Maturity Date\"\"). The Junior Subordinated Notes may not be repaid prior to the Final Maturity Date if the Enhanced Capital Requirement would be breached immediately before or after giving effect to such repayment of the Junior Subordinated Notes, unless the Company, Enstar Finance or another subsidiary of the Company replaces the capital represented by the Junior Subordinated Notes to be repaid with capital having equal or better capital treatment as the Junior Subordinated Notes under applicable insurance supervisory laws. The Junior Subordinated Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture provide for the following events of default (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods): nonpayment of principal or any premium when due (other than if Enstar Finance is required to postpone payment to satisfy certain redemption requirements); nonpayment of interest (except if due to a Mandatory Deferral Event); the Company's guarantee of the Junior Subordinated Notes ceases to be in full force and effect (other than a permitted release of the guarantee); or certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of Enstar Finance or the Company. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes may declare the principal and accrued and unpaid interest on all of the Junior Subordinated Notes to be due and payable immediately. 1 The foregoing descriptions of the Junior Subordinated Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture are qualified by reference to the agreements themselves, which are attached as exhibits to this report.\",\n",
        "    \"    Notwithstanding the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of the Notes and other cost reduction measures, the Company continues to actively pursue additional financing, and the Board of Directors has initiated a review of strategic alternatives for the Company, including retaining advisors to assist in the strategic review process.    The Company has used the proceeds of the Notes to satisfy certain of its current liabilities. However, even after the application of the proceeds, management anticipates that, in the absence of additional sources of liquidity, the Company's existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows from operations will not be sufficient to meet the Company's operating and liquidity needs beyond the end of December 2022.    In the event the Company determines that additional sources of liquidity will not be available to it or will not allow it to meet its obligations as they become due, the Company may need to file a voluntary petition for relief under the United States Bankruptcy Code in order to implement a plan of reorganization, court-supervised sale and/or  liquidation. Furthermore, in the event the Company is unable to pursue bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, it may be necessary to pursue bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, in which case a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate the Company's assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Company expects that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to stakeholders than those it might obtain under Chapter 11 primarily because of the likelihood that the Company's assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of by a Chapter 7 trustee in a distressed fashion over a short period of time rather than sold by existing management as a going concern business. In the event that the Company pursues bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7, the Company's material business activities will cease, and the Company will no longer have the capability to prepare financial statements and other disclosures required for periodic reports for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company expects that no distributions would be available for stockholders in a Chapter 7 liquidation.    Forward-Looking Statements    Certain statements in this Current Report on Form  8-K  may be considered forward-looking statements, including statements with respect to the Company's expectations with respect to the sufficiency of the Company's cash resources and the ability to secure additional sources of liquidity, the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and the potential need to pursue bankruptcy protection.

The Restatement Agreement provides for the restatement of the existing revolving credit facility agreement primarily in order to: (1) reduce the applicable margin factor, (2) permit the Company to provide guarantees in the ordinary course of its insurance business without prior approval from the lenders, (3) provide for a utilization fee on amounts drawn, (4) add SunTrust as a new lender within the facility, replacing RBC and (5) allow the Company to obtain additional commitments of up to $166.25 million, on and subject to the terms of a restated facility agreement (the \"\"Restated Facility Agreement\"\"). The Restated Facility Agreement provides for an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (expiring in September 2019) pursuant to which the Company is permitted to borrow up to an aggregate of $665.0 million (the \"\"Credit Facility\"\"), which is available to fund permitted acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. Each of the lenders under the Restated Facility Agreement has agreed to provide an equal amount of $166.25 million to fund the Credit Facility, and pursuant to the Restated Facility Agreement, the Company has the option to obtain additional commitments under the Credit Facility up to an aggregate of $166.25 from the existing lenders or through the addition of one or more new lenders subject to the terms of the agreement. Interest is payable at the end of each interest period chosen by the Company or, at the latest, each six months. The interest rate is LIBOR plus a margin factor, which is subject to variation in the event of a change to the Company's long term senior unsecured debt rating assigned by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services or Fitch Ratings Ltd. Under the Restated Facility Agreement, the Company will pay usual and customary commitment and utilization fees that vary based on the aggregate amount of loans outstanding.  The Restated Facility Agreement imposes various financial and business covenants on the Company and its subsidiaries, including certain limitations on mergers and consolidations, acquisitions, indebtedness and guarantees, restrictions as to dispositions of stock and assets, and limitations on liens. The Restated Facility Agreement permits the Company to enter into guarantees during the ordinary course of its insurance business without prior approval from the lenders. During the existence of any event of default (as specified in the Restated Facility Agreement), the agent may cancel the commitments of the lenders, declare all or a portion of outstanding amounts immediately due and payable or declare all or a portion of outstanding amounts payable upon demand. In the event of a payment default, interest would accrue on the unpaid amount from the due date up to the date of actual payment at a rate that is 1.0% higher than the interest rate then in effect. The Credit Facility terminates and all amounts borrowed must be repaid on the fifth anniversary of September 16, 2014, the date on which the Credit Facility was originally entered into.

Prior to effectiveness of the Eleventh Amendment, the Company was prohibited from issuing unsecured notes in excess of $4.0 billion, and  any issuance of unsecured notes after November 2, 2013 would have resulted in a reduction in the Companys borrowing base equal to the lesser of (i) $300 for every $1,000 of aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes issued  by the Company or (ii) such other amount, if any, as determined prior to the issuance of such notes by lenders holding at least two-thirds of the outstanding credit exposure and unused commitments under the Amended and Restated Credit  Agreement. The Eleventh Amendment removes the $4.0 billion limit on the Companys ability to issue unsecured notes as well as the provision requiring that any issuance of unsecured notes after November 2, 2013 would result in a reduction  of the borrowing base under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.    The Eleventh Amendment also allows the Company to make  restricted payments in an aggregate amount up to $250.0 million plus (i) 50% of the Companys consolidated net income (or, in the case of a consolidated net loss, minus 100% of such deficit) beginning January 1, 2013 and (ii) 66  2/3% of the aggregate net cash proceeds received by the Company from any issuances of shares of common stock on or after January 1, 2013.

The Eleventh Amendment permits the Company to enter into commodities hedging arrangements with aggregate notional volume for any given month that do not exceed (i) 90% of the  Companys forecasted production of oil and natural gas reserves, based on internal engineering reports, for any given month during the succeeding one-year period and (ii) 80% of the Companys forecasted production of oil and natural  gas reserves, based on internal engineering reports, for any given month during the remaining four years of the succeeding five-year period. In addition, the Eleventh Amendment provides that the Company may enter into commodities hedging  arrangements covering up to 70% of its forecasted production of oil and natural gas reserves, based on internal engineering reports, with respect to estimated reserves to be acquired in connection with certain acquisitions.  Finally, the Eleventh Amendment reaffirms the Companys current borrowing base of $3.0 billion and maintains the lenders  aggregate commitments of $2.5 billion under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

Finally, the Sixth Amendment increases the limit on the Companys aggregate outstanding senior  unsecured notes from $900 million to $1.9 billion and allows the Company to issue additional senior  unsecured notes prior to May 1, 2012 without any reduction in the borrowing base as a result of the  issuance of such notes.

(MSSF), as administrative agent and collateral agent, the other agents party thereto and the lenders referred to therein (collectively, the Lenders). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Lenders have provided $250,000,000 in senior secured first lien term loans (the Term Loans). The proceeds from the Term Loans will be used by the Company to  redeem in full the LABA PhaRMA sm  9.0% Fixed Rate Term Notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes), issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated Indenture, dated as of August 3, 2016 (as further amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time prior to its termination hereunder, the LABA Indenture), by and between LABA Royalty Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Innoviva (LABA Royalty Sub), as the issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association (U.S. Bank), as trustee of the 2029 Notes (in such capacity, the LABA Trustee), and to pay related fees and expenses.  The Term Loans bear interest based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured, at Innovivas option, at an alternative base rate equal to the highest of the (a) prime rate, (b)  1/2 of 1% per annum above the federal funds effective rate, (c) LIBOR for an interests period of one month plus 1.00% and (d) 2.00% (the Base Rate) or LIBOR, plus a margin. The margin for Base Rate borrowings under the Credit Agreement is 3.50% and for LIBOR borrowings under the Credit Agreement is 4.50%. Borrowings based on LIBOR under the Credit Agreement will be subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor. Interest for Base Rate-based loans is calculated on the basis of a 365/366-day year and interest for LIBOR-based loans is calculated on the basis of a 360-day year.  Subject to certain customary exceptions, all obligations of Innoviva under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by Innovivas wholly owned subsidiary, Advanced Medicine East, Inc., and will be required to be guaranteed by each of Innovivas subsequently acquired or organized direct and indirect restricted wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries whose assets or net revenues exceed 5% of the consolidated assets or net revenues, as the case may be, of Innoviva and its restricted subsidiaries (the Guarantors). Other domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain customary exceptions, will be required to become Guarantors to the extent that domestic restricted subsidiaries excluded from such guarantee obligation represent, in the aggregate, more than 10% of the consolidated assets and more than 10% of the consolidated net revenues of Innoviva.  The obligations under the Credit Agreement are Innovivas and the Guarantors senior secured obligations, collateralized by a lien on substantially all of Innovivas and the Guarantors personal property and material real property assets (if any) (subject in each case to certain customary exceptions).  The Term Loans may be prepaid, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, except that (i) prepayments financed by the incurrence of lower-yielding indebtedness (other than in connection with certain change-of-control or transformative acquisitions) within six months from August 18, 2017 will be subject to a prepayment premium of 1.0% of the principal amount prepaid and (ii) lenders will be compensated for LIBOR breakage costs (if any).  The Term Loans mature five years following the effective date. The Credit Agreement requires quarterly principal payments equal to 2.50% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans.  Additionally, the Credit Agreement stipulates an annual principal payment of a percentage of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) (ECF) to repay the Term Loans.

Innoviva can request, at any time and from time to time, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, the establishment of one or more incremental term loan facilities with commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed, (i) (x) in the case of incremental term loans secured on a pari passu basis with the Term Loans, an amount such that the consolidated first lien secured leverage ratio of the Company calculated on a pro forma basis would not be greater than 2.00 to 1.00 or (y) in the case of incremental term loans secured on a junior basis to the Term Loans or unsecured, an amount such that the consolidated leverage ratio of the Company calculated on a pro forma basis would not be greater than 3.56 to 1.00, plus (ii) the greater of (x) $75,000,000 and (y) 45% of the prior four quarters consolidated EBITDA of the Company, plus (iii) the amount of any voluntary prepayments of the Term Loans other  than such voluntary prepayments financed with the proceeds of long term indebtedness. Lenders are not obligated to commit to provide any such incremental term loan facility requested by Innoviva.  The Credit Agreement also contains restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, Innovivas ability and that of Innovivas restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred equity, pay dividends or make other distributions or other restricted payments, make certain investments, create restrictions on distributions from subsidiaries (including prepayments of junior indebtedness), amend the terms of certain other indebtedness, create liens on certain assets, sell certain assets, consolidate, merge, liquidate, dissolve, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, enter into certain hedging arrangements, alter its line of business and enter into certain transactions with affiliates.

The net proceeds from the sale of the $192.5 million aggregate principal amount of Notes were approximately $187.3 million after deducting the Initial Purchasers discounts and commissions and Innovivas estimated offering expenses. Innoviva used approximately $17.5 million of the net proceeds from this offering to repurchase 1,317,771 shares of its common stock, at a price per share of $13.28, concurrently with the pricing of the offering of the Notes in privately negotiated transactions effected through one of the Initial Purchasers or its affiliate, as Innovivas agent.

Indenture  On August 7, 2017, Innoviva entered into an indenture (the Indenture) with respect to the Notes with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the Trustee). Under the Indenture, the Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Innoviva and bear interest at a rate of 2.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2018. The Notes will mature on August 15, 2025, unless earlier repurchased or converted.  The Notes are convertible into shares of Innovivas common stock, cash or a combination of shares of Innovivas common stock and cash, at Innovivas election, based on an initial conversion rate of 57.9240 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $17.26 per share), subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 30% to the $13.28 per share closing price of Innovivas common stock on August 1, 2017.  Prior to February 15, 2025, the Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders only upon the occurrence of specified events and during certain periods, and will be convertible on or after February 15, 2025 at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Notes.  If certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change as set forth in the Indenture occur prior to the maturity date, the conversion rate may, in certain circumstances, be increased for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such corporate event.  The conversion rate is subject to customary anti-dilution provisions.  The Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity, and no sinking fund is provided for the Notes. If Innoviva undergoes a fundamental change, as defined in the Indenture, subject to certain conditions, holders may require Innoviva to purchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes. The fundamental change purchase price will be 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date.  The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare 100% of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, all the Notes to be due and payable immediately.  2  The above description of the Indenture and the Notes is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture (and the Form of Note included therein), which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.\",\n",

The Company plans to acquire SeaBright by way of a merger of AML Acquisition with and into SeaBright (the Merger), with SeaBright surviving the Merger as an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the  Company. As of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, AML Acquisition has not borrowed any of the amount available under the SeaBright Facility. Consummation of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of  certain regulatory approvals. The Merger is currently expected to close in the first quarter of 2013.    The SeaBright Facility  is currently secured by a security interest in all of the assets of AML Acquisition, as well as a pledge of the stock of AML Acquisition by its sole stockholder. Following completion of the Merger, SeaBright (as the survivor of the Merger) would  become the borrower under the SeaBright Facility and the facility would be secured by a security interest in all of the assets of SeaBright, a pledge of the stock of SeaBright by its sole stockholder, a pledge of the stock of SeaBright Insurance  Company, Paladin Managed Care Services, Inc., and PointSure Insurance Services, Inc. (which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of SeaBright) by SeaBright, and a security interest in all of the assets of Paladin Managed Care Services, Inc. and PointSure  Insurance Services, Inc.    From the date of the SeaBright Facility until the date that is one month after the completion of the  Merger, the undrawn and uncancelled amount of the SeaBright Facility will incur a fee of 1% per annum. Interest on amounts borrowed will be payable at the end of each interest period chosen by the borrower or, at the latest, each six months.  The interest rate will be LIBOR plus 2.75% for the first 18 months from the date on which the loan under the SeaBright Facility is made, and will increase to LIBOR plus 3.50% thereafter; the interest rate is subject to increase by an incremental  amount tied to certain regulatory costs, if any, that may be incurred by the lenders. The SeaBright Facility imposes various financial and business covenants on AML Acquisition (and, following completion of the Merger, SeaBright), including  limitations on mergers and consolidations, acquisitions, indebtedness and guarantees, restrictions as to dispositions of stock and assets (except for certain permitted dispositions), restrictions on dividends, and limitations on liens.  During the existence of any payment default, the interest rate would be increased by 1.0%. During the existence of any event of default  (as specified in the SeaBright Facility), the lenders may cancel their commitments, declare all or a portion of outstanding amounts immediately due and payable, declare all or a portion of borrowed amounts payable upon demand, or proceed against the  security. The SeaBright Facility terminates and all amounts borrowed must be repaid on the fourth anniversary of the date the term loan is made.
